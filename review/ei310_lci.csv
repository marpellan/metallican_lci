Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals. The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments. The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone. The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium. The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium.The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs). Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen. After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes. In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots. At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.
PLATINUM MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex. The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output. Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value. In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies. The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

Technology:  The ores from the different ore bodies are processed in concentrators where a PGM concentrate is produced with a tailing by product. The PGM base metal concentrate product from the different concentrators processing the different ores are blended during the smelting phase to balance the sulphur content in the final matte product. Smelter operators also carry out toll smelting from third part concentrators. The smelter product is send to the Base metal refinery where the PGMs are separated from the Base Metals. Precious metal refinery is carried out on PGM concentrate from the Base metal refinery to split the PGMs into individual metal products.

Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.

The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
HEAP LEACHING:
The recovery processes of the Misima Mine are cyanide leach and carbon in pulp (CIP). The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: The recovery process in the Porgera Mine is pressure oxidation and cyanide leach. The slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks. 
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled. 
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.
WATER SUPPLY:
For Misima Mine, process water is supplied from pit dewatering bores and in-pit water. Potable water is sourced from boreholes in the coastal limestone.
For Porgera Mine, the main water supply of the mine is the Waile Creek Dam, located approximately 7 kilometres from the mine. The reservoir has a capacity of approximately 717, 000 m3 of water. Water for the grinding circuit is also extracted from Kogai Creek, which is located adjacent to the grinding circuit. The mine operates four water treatment plants for potable water and five sewage treatment plants.
ENERGY SUPPLY:
For Misima Mine, electricity is produced by the mine on site or with own power generators, from diesel and heavy fuel oil.
For Porgera Mine, electricity is produced by the mine on site. Assumed with Mobius / Wohlwill electrolysis. Porgera's principal source of power is supplied by a 73-kilometre transmission line from the gas fired and PJV-owned Hides Power Station. The station has a total output of 62 megawatts (“MW”). A back up diesel power station is located at the mine and has an output of 13MW. The average power requirement of the mine is about 60 MW. 
For both Misima and Porgera Mines, an 18 MW diesel fired power station supplies electrical power. Diesel was used in the station due to the unavailability of previously supplied heavy fuel oil.

Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore","copper, anode",RU,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in the Russian Federation.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore","copper concentrate, sulfide ore",CL,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in Chile.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

nickel,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"cement production, CP V RS",nickel smelter slag,BR,kilogram,"The dataset describes the production of sulphate resistant Portland cement in Brazil (CP-V-RS). This cement type must meet the sulphate resistance requirements set by the Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 5737:1991.
Sulphate resistant cement is a hydraulic binder that meets the condition of resistance to sulphates. It is made by the grinding of Portland clinker together with one or more forms of calcium sulfate. During grinding it is allowed to add granulated blast furnace slag or pozzolanic materials and/or carbonaceous materials. Cements are considered sulphate resistant if the C3A content of clinker is equal to or lower than 8% and the content of carbonaceous additions is equal to or lower than 5% in relation to total binder mass. In the case of high early resistance cements (like in this dataset), it is allowed to add blast furnace slag or pozzolanic materials to the cement composition. Other cement types (not only CP-V) can also be classified as sulphate resistant, but they are not the object of this dataset.
Six types of Portland and blended cement types represent Brazilian production. The table below presents the different cement types and compositions according to Brazilian standards (NBR 11578:1991, NBR 5735:1991, NBR 5736:1991, NBR 5733:1991).
CP V represents 8.5% of the market according to the National Union of the Cement Industry (SNIC, 2013). 50% of it is assumed to be standard high early strength (CP-V-ARI) and the other 50% is assumed to be sulphate resistant (CP-V-RS). It is used in applications that require sulphate resistance, such as infrastructure for sewage systems (domestic or industrial), concrete elements exposed to sea water or installed in sulphate-rich soils.
This dataset contains information from clinker stockpile to cement ready to be shipped in bulk. After the clinker is cooled from the rotary kiln, it is ground in ball or roller mills to particles under 75 μm size. Then it goes to silos where it is mixed with calcium sulphate (gypsum) and SCMs. The mixed cement goes to a finishing mill and then it is stored in cement silos, ready to be shipped in bulk or packed.

The production volume represents the total amount of hydroelectricity used for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting) in the region. 
The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the hydroelectricity in the region. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of hydroelectricity produced by the different technologies (reservoir, run-of-river,  pumped storage) is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of hydroelectricity coming from each country within Area 1 (using country-specific aluminium production volumes supplied by the International Aluminium Institute and International Energy Agency data on electricity sources within each country) and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of hydroelectricity into different technologies. For countries whose electricity production is not modelled in ecoinvent (all but ZA for this Area 1), hydroelectricity is assumed to be produced in non-alpine reservoir hydroelectric plants.

However, the consideration of this waste species as “average incineration residue"" should be understood as a guess done to cope with missing information on the specific composition. Transport requirements recalculated either using ecoinvent standard distances for Europe (e.g. for chemicals) or given average distances by train from Chinese 2004 statistics or own assumptions. Yellowcake is asssumed to be delivered in China from Australia, because the domestic uranium production in China is likely not sufficient for all plants. Uncertainties have been increased with regard to the original dataset for the US plant, when necessary. Product loss has been assumed 0.3% vs. 0.1% of the US dataset, and relevant uncertainty increased. This dataset has been developed with the goal to serve a preliminary estimation of the Chinese nuclear chain for the Chinese electricity mix. Hence, it cannot be used for comparisons of conversion among countries.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore",sulfuric acid,RU,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in the Russian Federation.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",PG,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Papua New Guinea. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of potash salt, with 10% K2O, at the mine. Commercial potash deposits come originally from evaporite deposits and are often buried deep below the earth's surface. Potash ores are rich in potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl) and other salts and clays, and are obtained by conventional shaft mining with the extracted ore ground into a powder. Other methods include dissolution mining and evaporation methods from brines. In the evaporation method, hot water is injected into the potash which is dissolved and then pumped to the surface where it is concentrated by solar induced evaporation. Amine reagents are then added to either the mined or evaporated solutions. In this dataset, shaft mining technology is assumed.
Potash salt is used as potassium (K) containing fertiliser.
Data on ore extraction and fuel used where collected from Fertilizers Europe. Infrastructure were assumed similar to those of dolomite production as per Althaus et al (2007).
The main data source for this dataset is Fertilizers Europe (2014), complemented by Althaus et al (2007).

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",CA,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Canada. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

This includes the operations at the mining site located in Quebec, i.e. mining, benefication and a first refining, which leads to the production of doré bars, containing gold, silver and impurities. 
Specific data were collected from 3 mines that produced doré bars in Quebec. These mines represent about 98% of Quebec gold production and about 95% of Quebec silver production from combined gold-silver mines. Share is estimated as the production statistics for 2012-2013 are not published yet and considers gold-silver mines only (not gold and silver coming from other mines). One mine is an open-pit mine and the two others are underground. A weighted average of 839 tonnes of ore is extracted per kg of gold produce. The recovery rate of gold is known for two of the mines (89% and 91%) and the recovery rate of silver known for only one mine (76%). 
Note that the mine infrastructure are extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset, where the modelled mines are open pit. This is not representative of the Quebec situation where two of the three modelled mine are underground. Thus a mine infrastrucuture, gold and silver, Québec will eventually be created in order to reflect the Québec specificity. 
In order to create a dataset with gold and silver as outputs (to comply with the boundaries of the GLO dataset), a very simplified modeling of the refining of the doré bars to produce gold and silver has been added to this dataset although it is done in Ontario (Canada) : electricity use is extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, PE and PG datasets and infrastructure extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset. 
It is assume that the refining efficency is 100% (i.e. no loss of gold).

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore","copper concentrate, sulfide ore",CN,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in China.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

Technology:  Open-pit mining is applied and hydraulic excavators are used to extract the ore with different grades, which is transported to stockpiles awaiting homogenization through earth-moving equipment in order to attain the same concentration.
Conveyor belts (3.5 km) are utilized to transport the homogenized ore to the concentration unit.
Initially, the ore passes through a jaw crusher and moves to the ball mills, where the pyrochlore grains (1 mm average diameter) are reduced to diameters less than 0.104 mm. In the ball mills, recycled water is added in order to i) granulate the concentrate and ii) remove the gas from the sintering unit. The granulated ore undergoes i) magnetic separation, where magnetite is removed and is sold as a coproduct and ii) desliming in order to remove fractions smaller than 5μm by utilizing cyclones. Then the ore enters the flotation process - last stage of the beneficiation process – where the pyrochlore particles come into contact with flotation chemicals (hydrochloric & fluorosilic acid, triethylamene and lime), thereby removing the solid fractions and producing pyrochlore concentrate and barite as a coproduct which is also sold. The produced concentrate contains 55% Nb2O5 and 11% water and moves to the sintering unit, via tubes or is transported in bags while the separated and unused minerals enter the tailings dam.
In the sintering unit, the pyrochlore concentrate undergoes pelletizing, sintering, crushing and classification. These units not only accumulate the material but are also responsible for removing sulfur and water from the concentrate. Then the concentrate enters the dephosphorization unit, where phosphorus and lead are removed from the concentrate. The removal of sulphur and phosphorus have to be executed because of the local pyrochlore ore composition. Then the concentrate undergoes a carbothermic reduction by using charcoal and petroleum coke, producing a refined concentrate, 63% Nb2O5 and tailings with high lead content that are disposed in the tailings dam again.

The Becher process consists in reducing iron oxide thermally and the leaching of impurities with mineral acid. The first step is an almost complete reduction of iron oxide to its metallic form using in a rotary kiln with coal at temperature of 1200°C.  Then the char is removed from the reduced ilmenite by processing it through screening and magnetic separation. The char is recycled to the rotary kiln. The reduced ilmenite is leachate with ammonium chloride under aeration to oxidize and precipitate the iron into iron oxides. The iron oxides are separated by cycloning. The remaining synthetic rutile is purified by leaching using sulfuric acid. The residual iron is removed by leaching using sulfuric acid.

titanium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"electrolysis of magnesium chloride, from titanium sponge production","chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production",JP,kilogram,"This dataset models the electrolysis of 1 kg of magnesium chloride produced during the production of titanium sponge using the Kroll process, which is modelled by the following reaction: TiCl4+ 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2. The electrolysis of magnesium chloride separates the magnesium from the chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2. The recovered Mg is fed back to the reduction and distillation process (which produces titanium sponge) and the chlorine is fed back to the chlorination and refining process (which produces titanium tetrachloride).
This dataset is a copy of the dataset covering the geography of China (CN), which is based on Gao et al. (2018). The data is assumed to be representative also of the Japanese situation, since the Kroll process is the most commonly used method for the production of titanium sponge.
Reference:

Geography:  The dataset has been approximated from the respective dataset for CN. The data is assumed to be representative also of the Japanese situation.
Technology:  The reduction and distillation step of the Kroll process produces titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2.
After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.
According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.
Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.
Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.
0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore","copper, anode",JP,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in Japan.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

The production volume represents the total amount of hydroelectricity used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the hydroelectricity in the region. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of hydroelectricity produced by the different technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage) is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of hydroelectricity coming from each country within Area 4/5 (using country-specific aluminium production volumes, supplied by the International Aluminium Institute, and International Energy Agency data on electricity sources within each country) and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of hydroelectricity into different technologies for IN, ID, JP MY, IR and TR. For countries whose electricity production is not modelled in ecoinvent (AZ, KZ and TJ), hydroelectricity is assumed to be produced in non-alpine reservoir hydroelectric plants.
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,treatment of copper scrap by electrolytic refining,"copper, cathode",RER,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of copper cathodes, by electrolyti refining, in 2003. It is designed for the use of the metal as part of the consumption mix 'copper, at regional storage'. It is not to be used if the impact of the secondary copper is considerable. In such cases, a more detailed analysis has to be conducted.
Geography:  This module is valid for one single very big plant, which is taken as proxy for the RER.
Technology:  Secondary copper consists of various types of scrap. Prompt scrap is directly reused in foundries and is not further processed. Old scrap has to be treated in a secondary copper smelter, where a variety of metal values are recuperated. Depending on the chemical composition, the raw materials of a secondary copper smelter are processed in different types of furnaces, including: - blast furnaces (up to 30% of Cu in the average charge), - converters (about 75% Cu), and - anode furnaces (about 95% Cu).
A scheme of the process considered is given in Fig 1. The blast furnace metal (“black copper”) is treated in a converter; then, the converter metal is refined in an anode furnace. In each step additional raw material with corresponding copper content is added. In the blast furnace, a mixture of raw materials, iron scrap, limestone and sand as well as coke is charged at the top. Air that can be enriched with oxygen is blown through the tuyeres. The coke is burnt and the charge materials are smelted under reducing conditions. Black copper and slag are discharged from tapholes.
The converters used in primary copper smelting, working on mattes containing iron sulphide, generate surplus heat and additions of scrap copper are often used to control the temperature. The converter provides a convenient and cheap form of scrap treatment, but often with only moderately efficient gas cleaning. Alternatively, hydrometallurgical treatment of scrap, using ammonia leaching, yields to solutions which can be reduced by hydrogen to obtain copper powder. Alternatively, these solutions can be treated by solvent extraction to produce feed to a copper-winning cell.
Converter copper is charged together with copper raw materials in anode furnace operation. For smelting the charge, oil or coal dust is used, mainly in reverberatory furnaces. After smelting, air is blown on the bath to oxidise the remaining impurities. Leaded brasses, containing as much as 3% of lead, are widely used in various applications and recycling of their scrap waste is an important activity. Such scrap contains usually much swarf and turnings coated with lubricant and cutting oils. Copper-containing cables and motors contain plastic or rubber insulants, varnishes, and lacquers. In such cases, scrap needs pre-treatment to remove these non-metallic materials. The smaller sizes of scrap can be pre-treated thermally in a rotary kiln provided with an after-burner to consume smoke and oil vapours (so-called Intal process).
Emissions and waste: Elevated levels of halogenated organic compounds may arise, such as TCDD. Slags are usually used in construction. Waste water is led to a communal treatment plant.

The electrolysis of magnesium chloride separates the magnesium from the chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2. The recovered Mg is fed back to the reduction and distillation process (which produces titanium sponge) and the chlorine is fed back to the chlorination and refining process (which produces titanium tetrachloride).
This dataset is a copy of the dataset covering the geography of China (CN), which is based on Gao et al. (2018). The data is assumed to be representative also of the global situation, since the Kroll process is the most commonly used method for the production of titanium sponge.

Geography:  The dataset has been approximated from the respective dataset for CN. The data is assumed to be representative also of the global situation.
Technology:  The reduction and distillation step of the Kroll process produces titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2.
After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.
According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.
Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.
Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.
0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore",molybdenite,RoW,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores globally.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

nickel,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"cement production, CP IV",nickel smelter slag,BR,kilogram,"The dataset describes the production of Portland pozzolan cement in Brazil (CP IV). This cement type has between 15% to 50% of pozzolan in mass composition and is specified by the Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 5736:1991.
The Pozzolan is a siliceous material with no (or low) cementing property, but when finely ground and in the presence of water, reacts with the calcium hydroxide produced by clinker""s hydration to form a cementing material. The pozzolanic reaction is slow compared with Ordinary Portland cement hydration; therefore, heat liberation and strength development are slow in concrete. The pozzolanic reaction is very efficient in filling up concrete pores, improving strength and impermeability of concrete. Pozzolans can be natural materials, such as volcanic stones with natural pozzolanic activity/; or artificial materials, including manufactured products (e.g. calcined clay) or byproducts from other industries (e.g. fly ash from coal thermal power plants).
Six types of Portland and blended cement types represent Brazilian production. The table below presents the different cement types and compositions according to Brazilian standards (NBR 11578:1991, NBR 5735:1991, NBR 5736:1991, NBR 5733:1991).
The CP IV cement type has 14.9% of the market according to Brazilian cement association (SNIC, 2013). This cement is produced in regions next to hard coal thermal electricity plants (fly-ash) / metallurgy plants (acid slags) areas using its byproduct; also, regions with the availability of natural pozzolan sources. This cement can also be produced with a range of calcined clays. This cement emits low heat for hydration and is recommend for massive concrete launches. Properties attained by using high pozzolan content in concrete are increasing resistance, less permeability and capillary porosity, which increase stability and durability. The CP IV cement consists of clinker, calcium sulfate, up to 5% of milled limestone, and 15-50% pozzolan or fly ash (see composition in the table).
This dataset contains information from clinker stockpile to cement ready to be shipped in bulk. After the clinker is cooled from the rotary kiln, it is ground in ball or roller mills to particles under 75 μm size. Then it goes to silos where it is mixed with calcium sulphate (gypsum) and SCMs. The mixed cement goes to a finishing mill and then it is stored in cement silos, ready to be shipped in bulk or packed.
This dataset uses “hard coal ash” as a proxy for fly ash, ""silica sand"" as a proxy for natural pozzolans and ""nickel smelter slag"" as a proxy for slags from metallurgical processes of nickel, copper and manganese.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"processing of anode slime from electrorefining of copper, anode",silver,GLO,kilogram,"For the processing of anode slimes from primary copper electrorefining globally.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere were taken from the treatment activity, “treatment of precious metal from electronics scrap, in anode slime, precious metal extraction”, which was used here as a proxy for the treatment of anode slime from primary copper production via pyrometallurgy. The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Further information is provided in the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020). Electrical energy demand was based on Chatterjee et al. (1996).

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",ID,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Indonesia. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Reference: ""The Environmental Performance of Refined Cobalt - Life Cycle Inventory and Life Cycle Assessment of Refined Cobalt - Summary Report"", CDI & ERM, Novermber 2016. PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport.

Electrometallurgical zinc smelting includes roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, melting, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. Pyrometallurgical zinc smelting includes sintering, leaching, refining, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset.

Geography:  This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. 
The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.
Image: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/5fe963ea-10cc-44e7-a6a9-b8b4871bc917
Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. 
Electrometallurgical Smelting
The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).
Pyro-metallurgical Smelting
The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 & 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then.

It is assumed that the overburden and the ore piles that are not transfered to the mill plant, are dumped back in the pit. Reclamation of the pit is not included in the module because of lack of information. However, by far the largest masses of waste originating in mining are found in the mill tailings.

Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore","copper, anode",CN,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in China.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

nickel,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation",CA,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Canada. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at nickel mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

This dataset is a disagreggation of the existing dataset ''nickel mine operation, sulfidic ore'', which contains smelting and refining on top of the mine operation. The disagreggation was done  because primary data was available for nickel mine operation but not for subsequent stages of smelting and refining. Thus, the production volume of this dataset is already included in the global dataset ''nickel mine operation, sulfidic ore, GLO''. Until data on smelting and refining become available, this dataset cannot be used as part of a life cycle assessment.

The sulfidic nickel ore is extracted in an underground mine, where 7.21 kg of ore are extracted per kg of concentrate produced. The recovery rate (metal in ore/metal in the concentrate) is 90% for Ni and 82% for Cu.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore",molybdenite,US,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in the United States.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from oil used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the countries providing the electricity from oil fired power plants. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
Calculations are based on statistics by the IAI (http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/)
Distribution of the total electricity production with oil in a specific area to the individual countries was calculated based on IEA statistics (IEA. 2010. Electricity information. IEA Statistics. International Energy Agency, Paris. ISBN 978-92-64-08418-6)

Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals. The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments. The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone. The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium. The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium.The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs). Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen. After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes. In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots. At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.
PLATINUM MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex. The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output. Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value. In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies. The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

Technology:  The ores from the different ore bodies are processed in concentrators where a PGM concentrate is produced with a tailing by product. The PGM base metal concentrate product from the different concentrators processing the different ores are blended during the smelting phase to balance the sulphur content in the final matte product. Smelter operators also carry out toll smelting from third part concentrators. The smelter product is send to the Base metal refinery where the PGMs are separated from the Base Metals. Precious metal refinery is carried out on PGM concentrate from the Base metal refinery to split the PGMs into individual metal products.

Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

aluminium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"electricity production, nuclear, aluminium industry","electricity, high voltage, aluminium industry",RoW,kilowatt hour,"This is a dataset used to create a global aluminium industry specific electricity market. The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from nuclear used globally for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using pressure water reactors and boiling water reactors is  is a weighted average of the share of each nuclear technology in aluminium-producing countries (weighted by nuclear power consumption for aluminium production). The share in each country is identical to the split used in ecoinvent v3.2. The share of each country in producing the global amount of nuclear power used in aluminium production was calculated regional data supplied by the International Aluminium Institute [IAI] and the European Aluminium Association [EAA], country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: EAA personal communication, IAI personnal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (sources: International Energy Agency or ecoinvent v3.2).

cadmium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"cadmium production, primary",cadmium,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset describes the primary production of 1 kg of cadmium metal (99.9%) in Quebec. This is a child dataset, with exchanges identical to the GLO dataset. It was created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators were adjusted accordingly.
The assumptions used for this dataset are the same as for the GLO: as roughly 70% of primary cadmium is produced as by-product by companies that produce refined zinc (in the activity ""primary zinc production from concentrate""), this dataset represents the remaining 30% of production of refined cadmium.
No secondary sources of cadmium from post consumer scrap are considered. Only the most important source is taken into account: the cadmium sludges from hydrometallurgical zinc operations (modelled in the activity ""primary zinc production from concentrate"").
For the use in applications where cadmium is a major constituent - e.g. in NiCd battery systems - the dataset should be complemented with additional specific emission factors and the secondary production process.
Geography:  Child dataset; the exchanges are identical to the GLO dataset. Created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly.
Technology:  Cadmium sludge formed in hydrometallurgical zinc operations by purification of zinc solution, via subsequent purification and oxidation of the sponge. Cadmium cathodes are formed by electrowinning. Other sources from pyrometallurgical zinc wastes and post consumer scrap (batteries) are disregarded.
OXIDATION & PURIFICATION
Cadmium is extracted by oxidizing the enriched starting materials solutions, remnants of hydrometallurgical zinc refining. In order to oxidize the cadmium, air is blown in . Cadmium is precipitated from the solution as a metal sponge by reduction with zinc dust. The precipitated sponge contains 90 % cadmium and only 2.5 % zinc. No heat is used for drying.
ELECTROWINNING
The cadmium sponge is precipitated directly in the tank with the electrolytic acid. The anode consists of lead, which does not dissolve, whereas the cathode is aluminum sheet. The current yield is ca. 93 %; the energy consumption is 1250 kWh per tonne of cadmium cathode sheet deposited. Typical impurity levels in electrolytic cadmium sheet are 5 - 10 ppm Cu, 15 - 20 ppm Pb, 5 - 10 ppm Tl, and 5 ppm Zn. The zinc dust used for cementation of the cadmium sponge is recovered later in the sludge of the electrolysis and will be returned into the zinc cycle.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,[],"{'data entry': {'name': 'David FitzGerald', 'email': 'fitzgerald@ecoinvent.org'}, 'data generator': {'name': 'Pascal Lesage', 'email': 'pascal.lesage@polymtl.ca'}}",

Hence the radioactive emissions (and spectrum) as well as the radioactive solid waste may have been somewhat underestimated. Data for the operation of a nuclear fuel fabrication facility are relatively old but emissions to water are complete for a US plant. Radioactive emissions to air and water have been taken or derived from two commercial German facilities: both (one operational, the other closed) exhibit emissions per unit of product fuel much lower than data published in the 1980s. An average value of the two plants is used. Zirconium for cladding is modelled as chromium, for lack of complete information on its metallurgical process; the uncertainty value reflects only the amount.

The temperature of the furnace is raised to its final temperature of about 1110°C, at the conical tip end approximately 100°C lower. The temperature of the growth tube is held for about 16 to 20hrs, then the furnace is rotated about 90° to a vertical position. After the temperature is stabilized, the tube is lowered at a rate of about 1.2mm/hr until the solution has completely solidified.”

This is in the North-Eastern region of the province KwaZulu-Natal.
The mineral sands are harvested via a system of ponds and floating dredges and the concentration is done on a floating gravity separation plant. These two stages of the process take place in the same location. The concentrator produces two streams: a magnetic and non-magnetic stream. The magnetic stream consists of ilmenite while the non-magnetic stream consists of zircon and rutile. 
This concentrate is transported to the second location where the Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) and the smelter are situated. At the MSP the various minerals are separated to produce zircon, rutile and ilmenite.
The ilmenite is smelted to produce titania slag (85% TiO2). High quality (low manganese content) pig iron is produced as a by-product in this stage. The ilmenite first undergoes an oxidizing roast followed by magnetic separation where the Cr2O3 fraction of the ilmenite is removed. The ilmenite is then partially reduced to 85% TiO2 slag in a six-in-line A.C. electric arc furnace

Geography:  The data used has no specific geographical origin as it is based on stoechiometric calculations and estimations. It is assumed to be representative of the production processes in this geography. Some values are based on data from a large chemical factory located in Germany. These are assumed to be valid for this geography.
Technology:  According to Zhang and Richardson (2016), the most common production method for copper(II) oxide is the use of hydrometallurgy. In this process, a solution of ammonia and ammonium carbonate leaches metallic copper in the presence of air. The leaching step involves three reaction steps, of which the first one is very slow compared to the following two steps. Therefore, only a continuous operation of the plant achieves good results. After the leaching step, several filtering and stripping steps are carried out before the copper(II) oxide can be dryied and packed. The used ammonia and carbon dioxide are recovered in the strip tank and go back to the starting point.
The overall reaction of the hydrometallurgical production of copper(II)oxide can be summarized out of the following two reaction steps (leaching and stripping):
4 Cu + O2 + 4 NH3 + 2 (NH4)2CO3 → 2 Cu2(NH3)4CO3 + 2 H2O
2 Cu2(NH3)4CO3 + O2 → 4 CuO + 8 NH3 + 2 CO2
The overall process yield is assumed to be 98%. The inventory is based on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in an internal waste water treatment plant assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).

As roughly 70% of primary cadmium is produced as by-product by companies that produce refined zinc (in the activity ""primary zinc production from concentrate""), this dataset represents the remaining 30% of production of refined cadmium.
No secondary sources of cadmium from post consumer scrap are considered. Only the most important source is taken into account: the cadmium sludges from hydrometallurgical zinc operations (modelled in the activity ""primary zinc production from concentrate"").
For the use in applications where cadmium is a major constituent – e.g. in NiCd battery systems – the dataset should be complemented with additional specific emission factors and the secondary production process.
Geography:  This dataset is meant to represent the average global production of primary cadmium from cadmium sludge.
Technology:  Cadmium sludge formed in hydrometallurgical zinc operations by purification of zinc solution, via subsequent purification and oxidation of the sponge. Cadmium cathodes are formed by electrowinning. Other sources from pyrometallurgical zinc wastes and post consumer scrap (batteries) are disregarded.
OXIDATION & PURIFICATION
Cadmium is extracted by oxidizing the enriched starting materials solutions, remnants of hydrometallurgical zinc refining. In order to oxidize the cadmium, air is blown in . Cadmium is precipitated from the solution as a metal sponge by reduction with zinc dust. The precipitated sponge contains 90 % cadmium and only 2.5 % zinc. No heat is used for drying.
ELECTROWINNING
The cadmium sponge is precipitated directly in the tank with the electrolytic acid. The anode consists of lead, which does not dissolve, whereas the cathode is aluminum sheet. The current yield is ca. 93 %; the energy consumption is 1250 kWh per tonne of cadmium cathode sheet deposited. Typical impurity levels in electrolytic cadmium sheet are 5 – 10 ppm Cu, 15 – 20 ppm Pb, 5 – 10 ppm Tl, and 5 ppm Zn.

Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is used in thin film solar cells as a junction partner in CIS (Copper-Indium-Diselenid) and Cd/Te solar cells. The CdS layer itself is not intended to absorb light but instead allows light to pass through to either the CIS or CdTe substrate. Therefore, the CdS layer must be thin (30 to 100 nanometre) in order to allow sufficient light to pass through. A purity of at least 99.99% (4N) is required. 
CdS is also used as pigment, that is valued for its good thermal stability in many polymers, for example in engineering plastics. By adding selenium in its formula it is possible to obtain colours ranging from a greenish yellow to red violet. Pigments do not necessarily need a purity as high as for solar cells.

Geography:  Production in US.
Technology:  Production of cadmium sulfide by the hydrometallurgical process. This aqueous technique of producing CdS involves a number of handling steps and is a complex procedure. According to a patent, the normal procedure is to “dissolve a cadmium salt in water, preferably the chloride or sulphate, and then bubble hydrogen sulfide through the solution to precipitate essentially all of the cadmium in the form of cadmium sulfide.” The reported yield is quite high; anionic and cationic impurities co-precipitates with the cadmium sulfide. The following purification involves extensive washing and leaching, until a high purity of the output product can be obtained.

Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals. The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments. The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone. The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium. The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium.The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs). Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen. After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes. In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots. At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.
PLATINUM MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex. The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output. Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value. In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies. The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

Technology:  The ores from the different ore bodies are processed in concentrators where a PGM concentrate is produced with a tailing by product. The PGM base metal concentrate product from the different concentrators processing the different ores are blended during the smelting phase to balance the sulphur content in the final matte product. Smelter operators also carry out toll smelting from third part concentrators. The smelter product is send to the Base metal refinery where the PGMs are separated from the Base Metals. Precious metal refinery is carried out on PGM concentrate from the Base metal refinery to split the PGMs into individual metal products.

The electrolysis of magnesium chloride separates the magnesium from the chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2. The recovered Mg is fed back to the reduction and distillation process (which produces titanium sponge) and the chlorine is fed back to the chlorination and refining process (which produces titanium tetrachloride).

Geography:  Dataset valid for the entire corresponding region.
Technology:  The reduction and distillation step of the Kroll process produces titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2.
After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.
According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.
Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.
Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.
0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.

This dataset describes the joint production of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Both mining and refining are included in this activity. The data on mining corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals. Data quality for emissions into air / water, as well as disposal of tailings, is low. Regarding the refining; gold and silver are supposed to be treated in the PGM plant in Rönnskär, whereas the other metals are supposed to undergo other treatments. A high share of the production is recycled metal, e.g. 74% for gold.
Geography:  Energy use and emissions during the mining are from Swedish mines. Material requirements during refinery for gold and silver are estimated with Australian data, cyanide consumption is estimated with US-Data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
HEAP LEACHING:
The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks.
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled.
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.

The actual countries covered by this region are Russia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The production volume represents the total amount of hydroelectricity used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the hydroelectricity in the region. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of hydroelectricity produced by the different technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage) is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of hydroelectricity coming from each country within the region (using country-specific aluminium production volumes, supplied by the International Aluminium Institute, and, for BA and ME, International Energy Agency data on electricity sources within each country) and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of hydroelectricity into different technologies. Exceptions to this methodology are: (1) share of hydroelectricity in the aluminium-specific grid mix were supplied by the IAI rather than determined by IEA data for RU; and hydropower was assumed to be from alpine reservoir plants for ME.
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

nickel,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation",RU,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation in a tailings impoundment in the Russian Federation. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at nickel mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore",sulfuric acid,IN,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in India.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

aluminium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"aluminium production, primary, ingot","aluminium, primary, ingot",UN-OCEANIA,kilogram,"The dataset represents the production of 1kg of primary aluminium ingot. Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al.

These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold mine operation and refining,zinc,SE,kilogram,"This dataset was created by merging two separate multi-output datasets from ecoinvent database v2; ""mining, gold-silver-zinc-lead-copper deposit"" and ""refining, copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver, in smelter"".
This dataset describes the joint production of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Both mining and refining are included in this activity. The data on mining corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals. Data quality for emissions into air / water, as well as disposal of tailings, is low. Regarding the refining; gold and silver are supposed to be treated in the PGM plant in Rönnskär, whereas the other metals are supposed to undergo other treatments. A high share of the production is recycled metal, e.g. 74% for gold.
Geography:  Energy use and emissions during the mining are from Swedish mines. Material requirements during refinery for gold and silver are estimated with Australian data, cyanide consumption is estimated with US-Data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
HEAP LEACHING:
The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks.
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled.
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.

Copper oxide occurs in nature as the black minerals tenorite and paramelaconite. Copper oxide is mostly used in the production of compounds for wood preservation and is also used as a precursor of a variety of copper (II) salts. Further areas of use or application are the feed industry (additives) and the glass and ceramic industry (pigment). (Zhang and Richardson 2016)
Due to a lack of data, this dataset is based on stoechiometric calculations as well as approximations based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).

Geography:  The data used has no specific geographical origin as it is based on stoechiometric calculations and estimations. It is assumed to be representative of the production processes in this geography. Some values are based on data from a large chemical factory located in Germany. These are assumed to be valid for this geography.
Technology:  According to Zhang and Richardson (2016), the most common production method for copper(II) oxide is the use of hydrometallurgy. In this process, a solution of ammonia and ammonium carbonate leaches metallic copper in the presence of air. The leaching step involves three reaction steps, of which the first one is very slow compared to the following two steps. Therefore, only a continuous operation of the plant achieves good results. After the leaching step, several filtering and stripping steps are carried out before the copper(II) oxide can be dryied and packed. The used ammonia and carbon dioxide are recovered in the strip tank and go back to the starting point.
The overall reaction of the hydrometallurgical production of copper(II)oxide can be summarized out of the following two reaction steps (leaching and stripping):
4 Cu + O2 + 4 NH3 + 2 (NH4)2CO3 → 2 Cu2(NH3)4CO3 + 2 H2O
2 Cu2(NH3)4CO3 + O2 → 4 CuO + 8 NH3 + 2 CO2
The overall process yield is assumed to be 98%. The inventory is based on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in an internal waste water treatment plant assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore","copper, anode",IN,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in India.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",PE,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Peru. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at nickel mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Modeled in the original dataset is the operation of a plant fabricating UO2 fuel for light water nuclear reactors (PWR and BWR), with no MOX (mixed oxides), no RepU (reprocessed fuel), and no HEU (highly enriched uranium from warheads) fuel elements. Data for the operation of a nuclear fuel fabrication facility are relatively old but emissions to water are complete for a US plant. Radioactive emissions to air and water have been taken or derived from two commercial German facilities: both (one operational, the other closed) exhibit emissions per unit of product fuel much lower than data published in the 1980s. An average value of the two plants is used. Zirconium for cladding is modelled as chromium, for lack of complete information on its metallurgical process; the uncertainty value reflects only the amount. This module is linked with one enrichment module with specific characteristics for the mix or enrichment processes and electricity supply mix; hence, before using the cumulated results of this module the conditions for enrichment should be verified.

Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

Geography:  Average values of European producers. The inventory is assumed to be representative of the global production.
Technology:  The present inventory uses low concentration ore ilmenite. The presence of iron in ilmenite leads to the cogeneration of iron sulfate. The sulfate process consists of the following sequential stages 
1. raw material import and preparation. The ore is stored in covered silos to avoid drying in case it becomes wet. It is then ground using large ball mills to produce particles typically 40-60 um for efficient dissolution with concentrated sulfuric acid. The main emissions at this stage are dust. This is collected by discharging the gas through bag filters. 
2. Digestion: reporting by EU producers indicates operation in batches is commonly used. The ilmenite is mixed with highly concentrated sulfuric acid (80-95%) and this is necessary to digest the feedstock containing TiO2. A highly exothermic reaction is initated by the addition of a measured quantity of steam at around 140°C.  The equation is summarized as: FeTiO3 + 2H2SO4 = TiOSO4 + 2H2O + FeSO4   The off-gases contain small quantities of dust, sulfur dioxide and acid fumes, which are removed by scrubbing. The resulting solid cake is dissolved in water and acid recycled from subsequent washing step. The primary intermediate from the reaction is titanyl suphate (TiOSO4),
3. Reduction: the digester liquor is contacted with scrap iron. This process generates a small amount of H2, which is returned to the air.
4. Clarification and crystallization: titanyl sufate is recovered from the solution and neutralised with lime before going to landfill. This material can be also used as inert filler. The clarified solution is pumped to bacth cooler/crystalisers to remove the bulk of the iron sulfate as the solid heptahydrate 'copperas'. This is widely used in water treatment and other industries. The iron-depleted product liquor is concentrated in evaporators.
5. Hydrolysis (hydrate precipitation). The reaction is:
TiOSO4 + 2H2O = TiO(OH)2 + H2SO4 
Precipitation of the hydrated TiO2 is achieved by boiling the liquor for some hours followed by cooling to 60°C. At this stage of the process, the spenc acid with a concentration of 20-25% H2SO4 and 10-15% soluble salts (mainly iron, aluminium and mangesium sulfates) arises and is either recycled or neutralised with lime to produce gypsum which is preferntially sold at local markets as a commercial product.
6. Calcination: The rotary kilns are directly fired with oil or gas. Scrubbing calciner gas treatment has been upgraded in the past in order to reduce SO2 emissions. SO2 is normally reduced to form sulfuric acid and then recycled in the process. 
7. Finishing. The resulting solid is cooled, milled, coated, washed, dried and micronised.

Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere were taken from the treatment activity, “treatment of precious metal from electronics scrap, in anode slime, precious metal extraction”, which was used here as a proxy for the treatment of anode slime from primary copper production via pyrometallurgy. The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Further information is provided in the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020). Electrical energy demand was based on Chatterjee et al. (1996).

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",MX,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Mexico. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Geography:  The Araxa carbonatite complex in Brasil is located about 6 km south of the city of Araxa in the state of Minas Gerais and serves as the largest known niobium reserve in the world. Since the 1960s, the complex has been mined by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao), being responsible today for more than 80% of the global niobium production. 
Technology:  Open-pit mining is applied and hydraulic excavators are used to extract the ore with different grades, which is transported to stockpiles awaiting homogenization through earth-moving equipment in order to attain the same concentration.
Conveyor belts (3.5 km) are utilized to transport the homogenized ore to the concentration unit.
Initially, the ore passes through a jaw crusher and moves to the ball mills, where the pyrochlore grains (1 mm average diameter) are reduced to diameters less than 0.104 mm. In the ball mills, recycled water is added in order to i) granulate the concentrate and ii) remove the gas from the sintering unit. The granulated ore undergoes i) magnetic separation, where magnetite is removed and is sold as a coproduct and ii) desliming in order to remove fractions smaller than 5μm by utilizing cyclones. Then the ore enters the flotation process - last stage of the beneficiation process – where the pyrochlore particles come into contact with flotation chemicals (hydrochloric & fluorosilic acid, triethylamene and lime), thereby removing the solid fractions and producing pyrochlore concentrate and barite as a coproduct which is also sold. The produced concentrate contains 55% Nb2O5 and 11% water and moves to the sintering unit, via tubes or is transported in bags while the separated and unused minerals enter the tailings dam.
In the sintering unit, the pyrochlore concentrate undergoes pelletizing, sintering, crushing and classification. These units not only accumulate the material but are also responsible for removing sulfur and water from the concentrate. Then the concentrate enters the dephosphorization unit, where phosphorus and lead are removed from the concentrate. The removal of sulphur and phosphorus have to be executed because of the local pyrochlore ore composition. Then the concentrate undergoes a carbothermic reduction by using charcoal and petroleum coke, producing a refined concentrate, 63% Nb2O5 and tailings with high lead content that are disposed in the tailings dam again.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting) in the region. The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the electricity from coal power plants. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from each country within EU27+EFTA; and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite. The share of coal electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total coal electricity used in aluminium production in the EU27+EFTA region (using regional data supplied by the International Aluminium Institute [IAI] and the European Aluminium Association [EAA]). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: EAA personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). Exceptions to the general procedure are Greece, Slovakia and Slovania, for which the IAI provided country-specific aluminium-specific grid mixes. 
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",RoW,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Separate energy data was provided by IAI for production of hydrate and calcination processes. The Al(OH)3 extraction process involves adding milled bauxite to a hot caustic soda (NaOH) solution, dissolving the aluminium-bearing minerals (gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore) present to form a sodium aluminate supersaturated solution or “pregnant liquor”. Flocculants are added to aid settling and the solution is progressively cooled causing aluminium hydroxide crystals to precipitate.

Rough estimate extrapolated from Nickel, 99.5%, at plant dataset (ecoinvent v2.2), representing a global technology of 1994. This dataset is created only to complete Mining and benefication of nickel ore, QC dataset in order to provide a useful product (nickel). The amount of copper refined is calculated based on concentrate caracterisation (see dataset Mining and benefication of nickel ore, QC/GLO). Concerning the other metals in the concentrate (Co, AU, AG, Pt, Pd, Rh; see mining and benefication of nickel ore, QC dataset), since the dataset used for the extrapolation only produced Ni and Cu, no information are avalaible at that time to estimate the inputs associated with the refining of other metals.
Geography:  Extrapolated from a global nickel production dataset.
Technology:  Extrapolated from a typical technology for smelting and refining of nickel ore.
MINING:
95% of sulphidic nickel ores are mined underground in depths between 200m and 1800m, the ore is transferred to the beneficiation. Widening of the tunnels is mainly done by blasting. The overburden – material, which does not contain PGM-bearing ore – is deposed off-site and is partially refilled into the tunnels.
Emissions: The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. The underground mining operations generate roughly 80 % of the dust emissions from open pit operations, since the major dust sources do not take place underground. Rain percolate through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater.
Waste: Overburden is deposed close to the mine. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
BENEFICIATION:
After mining, the ore is first ground. In a next step it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metallic particles from the PGM-bearing minerals. After this first concentration step, flotation is carried out to remove the gangue from the sulphidic minerals. For neutralisation lime is added. In the flotation several organic chemicals are used as collector, frother, activator, depressor and flocculant. Sometimes cyanide is used as depressant for pyrite. Tailings usually are led to tailing heaps or ponds. As a result, nickel concentrates containing 7 - 25% Ni are produced.
Emissions: Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Flotation produce effluents containing several organic agents used. Some of these chemicals evaporate and account for VOC emissions to air. Namely xanthates decompose hydrolytically to release carbon disulphide. Tailings effluent contains additional sulphuric acid from acid rock drainage.
Waste: Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
METALLURGY AND REFINING:
There are many different process possibilities to win the metal. The chosen process depends on the composition of the ore, the local costs of energy carrier and the local legislation. Basically two different types can be distinguished: the hydrometallurgical and the pyrometallurgical process, which paired up with the refining processes, make up five major production routes (See Tab.1). All this routes are covered, aggregated according to their market share in 1994.
https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/00ebef53-ae97-400f-a602-7405e896cb76
Pyrometallurgy. The pyrometallurgical treatment of nickel concentrates includes three types of unit operation: roasting, smelting, and converting. In the roasting step sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide and part of the iron is oxidised. In smelting, the roaster product is melted with a siliceous flux which combines with the oxidised iron to produce two immiscible phases, a liquid silicate slag which can be discarded, and a solution of molten sulphides which contains the metal values. In the converting operation on the sulphide melt, more sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide, and the remaining iron is oxidised and fluxed for removal as silicate slag, leaving a high-grade nickel – copper sulphide matte. In several modern operations the roasting step has been eliminated, and the nickel sulphide concentrate is treated directly in the smelter.
Hydrometallurgy: Several hydrometallurgical processes are in commercial operation for the treatment of nickel – copper mattes to produce separate nickel and copper products. In addition, the hydrometal-lurgical process developed by Sherritt Gordon in the early 1950s for the direct treatment of nickel sulphide concentrates, as an alternative to smelting, is still commercially viable and competitive, despite very significant improvements in the economics and energy efficiency of nickel smelting technology. In a typical hydrometallurgical process, the concentrate or matte is first leached in a sulphate or chloride solution to dissolve nickel, cobalt, and some of the copper, while the sulphide is oxidised to insoluble elemental sulphur or soluble sulphate. Frequently, leaching is carried out in a two-stage countercurrent system so that the matte can be used to partially purify the solution, for example, by precipitating copper by cementation. In this way a nickel – copper matte can be treated in a two-stage leach process to produce a copper-free nickel sulphate or nickel chloride solution, and a leach residue enriched in copper.
Refining: In many applications, high-purity nickel is essential and Class I nickel products, which include electrolytic cathode, carbonyl powder, and hydrogen-reduced powder, are made by a variety of refining processes. The carbonyl refining process uses the property of nickel to form volatile nickel-carbonyl compounds from which elemental nickel subsides to form granules. Electrolytic nickel refineries treat cast raw nickel anodes in a electrolyte. Under current the anode dissolves and pure nickel deposits on the cathode. This electrorefining process is obsolete because of high energy demand and the necessity of building the crude nickel anode by reduction with coke. It is still practised in Russia. Most refineries recover electrolytic nickel by direct electrowinning from purified solutions produced by the leaching of nickel or nickel – copper mattes. Some companies recover refined nickel powder from purified ammoniacal solution by reduction with hydrogen.
Emissions: In all of the metallurgical steps, sulphur dioxide is emitted to air. Recovery of sulphur dioxide is only economic for high concentrated off-gas. Given that In the beneficiation step, considerable amounts of lime are added to the ore for pH-stabilisation, lime forms later flux in the metallurgical step, and decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carry over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to the air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Chlorine is used in some leaching stages and is produced during the subsequent electrolysis of chloride solution. The chlorine evolved is collected and re-used in the leach stage. The presence of chlorine in wastewater can lead to the formation of organic chlorine compounds (AOX) if solvents etc. are also present in a mixed wastewater. VOCs can be emitted from the solvent extraction stages. A variety of solvents are used an they contain various complexing agents to form complexes with the desired metal that are soluble in the organic layer. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Cu, Ni, Co, As and Cr. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages are the most important sources. The leaching stages are usually operated on a closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.
In the refining step, the combustion of sulphur leads to emissions of SO2. Nitrogen oxides are produced in significant amounts during acid digestion using nitric acid. Chlorine and HCl can be formed during a number of digestion, electrolytic and purification processes. Chlorine is used extensively in the Miller process and in the dissolution stages using hydrochloric acid and chlorine mixtrues respectively. Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Large quantities of effluents contain amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Regarding the metallurgical step, several co-products, residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue, are generated. Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds. In the refining step, quantities of solid residuals are also generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (ironhydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).

Electrometallurgical zinc smelting includes roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, melting, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. Pyrometallurgical zinc smelting includes sintering, leaching, refining, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset. 
The below images present the system boundary in relation to the primary product, special high grade zinc.

Geography:  This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. 
The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.

Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. 
Electrometallurgical Smelting
The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).
Pyro-metallurgical Smelting
The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 & 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then. Moreover, the technology has not changed significantly in the time period between 2012 and 2019 and therefore this data is considered to be appropriate in modeling current zinc production.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Literature value.

[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:
 - copper production, from imported concentrates, DE, 1994 - 2003 (37179122-c1c7-4bcb-ae9d-a1f3a1b9a616)]
Geography:  This module is valid for the whole corresponding region. Some agents used like lime or sodium cyanide originate from data sets valid for Switzerland or Europe.
Technology:  The ore is pre-treated,  reduced and refined according to the country specific mix of process alternatives: reverberatory furnace 6.2%; flash smelting furnaces 76.0%; other 17.8%.; SX-EW 0.0%. An overall abatement for sulphur dioxide of 95.0% was estimated.
Pyrometallurgy:
The pyrometallurgical treatment of copper concentrates includes three types of unit operation: drying & roasting (pre-treatment), smelting & converting (reduction), and finally refining. In the roasting step sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide and part of the iron is oxidised. Drying is done by gas. In smelt-ing, the roaster product is melted with a siliceous flux which combines with the oxidised iron to produce two immiscible phases, a liquid silicate slag which can be discarded, and a solution of molten sulphides which contains the metal values. In the converting operation on the sulphide melt, more sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide, and the remaining iron is oxidised and fluxed for removal as silicate slag, leaving a high-grade copper sulphide matte. In several modern operations the roasting step has been eliminated, and the copper sulphide concentrate is treated directly in the smelter. The converted copper is referred to as blister copper with a purity of 98%
Emissions: In every process steps sulphur dioxide is emitted to air. Recovery of sulphur dioxide is only economic for high concentrated off-gas. SO2 emissions are by far the most important in the metallurgy. In the beneficiation step, considerable amounts of lime is added to the ore for pH-stabilisation. Lime forms later flux in the metallurgical step. Lime decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carries over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Cu, Ni, Co, As, and Cr. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages is the most important source. The leaching stages are usually operated on a closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.
Waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several co-products, residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue. Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds.
Refining:
Conventional refining comprises three stages: (1) pyrometallurgical or fire refining, (2) electrolytic refining, and (3) remelting of cathodes and casting of shapes. Fire refining is applied to crude copper from converters and furnaces, cement copper from hydrometallurgy, anode scrap from electrolytic refining, and high-grade copper scrap, chiefly unalloyed wire scrap. About 80 % of the world copper production is refined by electrolysis. This treatment yields copper with high electrical conductivity and provides for separation of valuable impurities, especially precious metals. Copper cathodes must be remelted and cast to shapes because the structure of copper formed by electro-crystallization is not suitable for working to semi finished products. Cathodes are remelted in several types of special furnaces that perform the tasks of melting, post refining (if necessary), holding, and casting.
Emissions: The combustion of sulphur leads to emissions of SO2. Nitrogen oxides are produced in significant amounts during acid digestion using nitric acid. Chlorine and HCl can be formed during a number of digestion, electrolytic, and purification processes. Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. Organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Large quantities of effluents contain substantial amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Like in the pyrometallurgical step, considerable quantities of solid residuals are generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (iron hydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Literature value.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",CN,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in China. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Geography:  Average values of five European producers.
Technology:  The present inventory uses by preference either high grade mineral ore rutile or an (artificially) upgraded ore - either via slag from a blast furnace or a synthetic rutile in which metals are leached out with dilute acid. The whole chloride process consists of the following sequential stages:
1. Raw material import and preparation: ore is sourced from outside Europe. An eventual (artifical) upgrade of the ore takes places at the quarry site of the primary ore. Before feeding the material into the TiO2 plant, the ore has to be dry - usually no drying is required. In case the moisture specification is exeeded, drying is done in flue-gas dryers. However, in the five here examined European plants, only one plant is using a drying system. Dry dust is thereby separated from the flue-gas by cyclones and filters and fed to the chlorinators. Feedstock of the required purity are purchased according to a set of specifications; specifications that are checked regularly.
2. Chlorination: ore containing TiO2 and coke are fed to a fluidised-bed reactor where an exothermic reactiion with chlorine gas takes place at 1000 °C. The primary reaction is: 2 TiO2 + 4 Cl2 + 3 C --> 2 TiCl4 + 2 CO + CO2. Impurities such as iron oxide will react in a similar manner (forming FeCl2 and CO). Impurities such as silica and zirconium do not chlorinate and may accumulate. The reactors may require total bed replacdement about once a year. In one plant, coke and unreacted bed material is separated and re-used.
3. Solid separation & waste solid metal chlorides treatment: The resulting vapour of TiCl4 plus other volatile metallic chloride impurities are cooled with recycled cold TiCl4, allowing the removal of some impurities. Solid metal chlorides are usually neutralised with lime which renders the residual metals insoluble before their disposal as a solid waste to landfill.
4. Condensation & Distillation: a majority of TiCl4 is condensed from the gas stream and pumped to a dedicated storage facility. More impurities and tetrachloride are removed from the gas stream by jet scrubbing with cold tetrachloride, which is also pumped to storage. The remaining gas stream is then passed for waste gas treatment (see below). Further purification of TiCl4 by distillation is carried out.
5. Oxidation: liquid TiCl4 and oxygen are preheated, then mixed. Oxidation of the TiCl4 to TiO2 and chlorine is carried out at between 900 and 1000 °C and 1500-2000 °C, in either a plasma arc furnace or in a toluene fired furnace, using oxygen injection. The overall reaction is TiCl4 + O2 --> TiO2 + 2 Cl2. This step is also used to control the final quality of the TiO2 crystal size to enable the product to be used as a pigment. Light metal chlorides are used to aid this process. The reaction products are cooled and the TiO2 powder is collected in bag filters and the chlorine recycled.
6. Cooling and separation: The product stream from the oxidation step is a mixture of chlorine, oxygen and TiO2 powder. After the exit from the reactor above, these are cooled by indirect water-cooling. TiO2 is slurried with water and transferred to the finishing stage (see below). Chlorine is separated in either of the following two ways: (i) absorption/desorption process - or (ii) direct recycling. In absorption/desorption process chain, the chlorine gas is drawn from the filters and then absorbed in liquid TiCl4 in an absorption column. This liquid is stored, whilst the tail-gases pass to a scrubber train, to remove residual chlorine. Chlorine is then recovered by desorption from the liquid TiCl4. The recycled chlorine is liquified and stored directly for the re-use. In the direct recycling process, the oxidation reactors are used at a higher pressure than the chlorinators - requiring however a precise synchronisation of the two process steps. 
7. Finishing. The resulting solid is cooled, milled, coated, washed, dried and micronised.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",PE,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Peru. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used in 'aluminium production Area 4/5' (Asia without China) for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from each country within Area 4/5; and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite. The share of coal electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total coal electricity used in aluminium production in the Area 4/5 region as reported by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: IAI personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal types used in coal power plants for IN, ID, JP MY and TR.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore","copper, anode",RoW,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes at the global level.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts are calculated as a weighted average of the amounts in the local datasets. The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at nickel mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as mining and concentration methods for zinc are consistent in all regions.
Mining
The mining of zinc ore includes underground and open cast mining processes. Within the global zinc industry, about 80% of zinc ore comes from underground mines and 20% from open pit or combination mines.
- Underground Mining: Access is via vertical shafts or inclined roadways. There are usually two access routes (one for mining personnel and materials, and one for the ore) for safety and for ease of ventilation (fresh air comes in one and is then exhausted out of the other). These are permanent structures and therefore require strong roof supports (often including ""bolts"" into the rock to tie the layers together for strength). Once at the correct depth has been reached, horizontal tunnels are driven to reach the ore deposit. These are often temporary, so the support requirements are less substantial. Transport for personnel and materials can be by train, truck or conveyor belts. The largest share of the consumed fuels is diesel followed by electricity. Other major inputs include explosives and water.
- Open Pit Mining: Hard-rock surface mining usually includes drilling, blasting, or a combination of both processes, and then lifting of the broken ore either into trucks or onto conveyors for transportation to the processing plant. This lifting is usually by excavator (electric or hydraulic; with shovel or backhoe configuration) or front-end loader.
Benefication (Comminution and Flotation)
Zinc ore is milled and mixed with water to recover a fine concentrate by gravity and elutriation techniques, creating a slurry. The separation process of the metal from the slurry is realized through the addition of various floatation chemicals.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore",sulfuric acid,RoW,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes at the global level.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts are calculated as a weighted average of the amounts in the local datasets. The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore",molybdenite,CL,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in Chile.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

The electrolysis of magnesium chloride separates the magnesium from the chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2. The recovered Mg is fed back to the reduction and distillation process (which produces titanium sponge) and the chlorine is fed back to the chlorination and refining process (which produces titanium tetrachloride).
This dataset is a copy of the dataset covering the geography of China (CN), which is based on Gao et al. (2018). The data is assumed to be representative also of the global situation, since the Kroll process is the most commonly used method for the production of titanium sponge.

Geography:  The dataset has been approximated from the respective dataset for CN. The data is assumed to be representative also of the global situation.
Technology:  The reduction and distillation step of the Kroll process produces titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2.
After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.
According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.
Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.
Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.
0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",AR,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Argentina. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of ''potash salt'' from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Europe. 
If 1 kg of this 'potash salt' is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.1 kg of Potassium as K2O.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"processing of anode slime from electrorefining of copper, anode",gold,GLO,kilogram,"For the processing of anode slimes from primary copper electrorefining globally.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere were taken from the treatment activity, “treatment of precious metal from electronics scrap, in anode slime, precious metal extraction”, which was used here as a proxy for the treatment of anode slime from primary copper production via pyrometallurgy. The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Further information is provided in the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020). Electrical energy demand was based on Chatterjee et al. (1996).

Priority was given to data contained in EAA (2008); Althaus (2009) was used only in cases where it was found to be more complete that EAA (2008).  Note that both sources are European in scope - this GLO dataset is therefore an extrapolation.
Remelters use mainly reverbatory furnaces, and this dataset is based on this furnace technology only.
The dataset excludes, for lack of access to data, salt slag and dross recycling.  According to EAA, this data gap represents approximately 10-20% of potential impacts, as calculated using the CML 2001 method.
The following emissions to air are reported in EAA 2008 but excluded from this dataset: CO (0.095 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), Dust/particulates (0.041 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), NOx (0.329 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), SO2 (0.051 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), and VOC (0.050 kg/tonne secondary aluminium).  These are assumed to be combustion emissions or electricity production emissions, conclusion arrived at by comparing gate-to-gate emissions with the cradle-to-gate emissions also reported in EAA 2008.  Their inclusion wouldhave led to double-counting.
While this dataset represents the remelting of post-consumer scrap aluminium, the inputs and outputs reported by EAA (2008) actually refer to refining of new scrap.  In the ecoinvent database, both the remelting of post-consumer scrap and new scrap is represented by two distinct but mostly identical datasets to enable the appropriate modeling of aluminium mass flow through the economy.  The use of new scrap remelting to represent prepared old scrap remelting is thought to be more accurate than the use of refining as a proxy for this activity.  The extrapolation is accounted for in the uncertainty.

TiCl4 is normally produced from rutile and in some cases from a mix of ilmenite concentrate, rutile and high-grade slag. Due to scarcity of natural rutile resources in China, the high-grade titanium slag is considered as the principal input. The dataset is based on the publication from Gao et al (2018).
Table 2 of the Gao et al (2018) publication, provides cradle-to-gate data for the production of 1 ton of Ti sponge. For this dataset, only the data provided in the column ''chlorination and refining'' in table 2 of the abovementioned publication were taken into account here, because the chlorination and refining process is the sole process for the production of TiCl4. The amount of high-grade titanium slag, which serves as the principal input for the production of TiCl4 has been estimated.

Other methods include dissolution mining and evaporation methods from brines. In the evaporation method, hot water is injected into the potash which is dissolved and then pumped to the surface where it is concentrated by solar induced evaporation. Amine reagents are then added to either the mined or evaporated solutions. In this dataset, shaft mining technology is assumed.

The product ''potash salt'' is connected to the generic market for ''inorganic potassium fertiliser, as K2O'' through this supplying activity. In the agricultural context, ''potash salt'' can be used directly as a fertilizer input to crop production, eventually with other chemicals; alternatively, a generic input of ''inorganic potassium fertiliser, as K2O'' can be used instead, and this will represent the regional consumption mix for his type of nutrient. A way in between is allowed by using the generic input ''inorganic potassium fertiliser, as K2O'' and link to the activity providing it from a specific chemical.
 In all cases, emissions associated to the application of the fertilizer have to be calculated in the crop production activity.

Geography:  Average values of European producers.
Technology:  The present inventory uses low concentration ore ilmenite. The presence of iron in ilmenite leads to the cogeneration of iron sulfate. The sulfate process consists of the following sequential stages 
1. raw material import and preparation. The ore is stored in covered silos to avoid drying in case it becomes wet. It is then ground using large ball mills to produce particles typically 40-60 um for efficient dissolution with concentrated sulfuric acid. The main emissions at this stage are dust. This is collected by discharging the gas through bag filters. 
2. Digestion: reporting by EU producers indicates operation in batches is commonly used. The ilmenite is mixed with highly concentrated sulfuric acid (80-95%) and this is necessary to digest the feedstock containing TiO2. A highly exothermic reaction is initated by the addition of a measured quantity of steam at around 140°C.  The equation is summarized as: FeTiO3 + 2H2SO4 = TiOSO4 + 2H2O + FeSO4   The off-gases contain small quantities of dust, sulfur dioxide and acid fumes, which are removed by scrubbing. The resulting solid cake is dissolved in water and acid recycled from subsequent washing step. The primary intermediate from the reaction is titanyl suphate (TiOSO4),
3. Reduction: the digester liquor is contacted with scrap iron. This process generates a small amount of H2, which is returned to the air.
4. Clarification and crystallization: titanyl sufate is recovered from the solution and neutralised with lime before going to landfill. This material can be also used as inert filler. The clarified solution is pumped to bacth cooler/crystalisers to remove the bulk of the iron sulfate as the solid heptahydrate 'copperas'. This is widely used in water treatment and other industries. The iron-depleted product liquor is concentrated in evaporators.
5. Hydrolysis (hydrate precipitation). The reaction is:
TiOSO4 + 2H2O = TiO(OH)2 + H2SO4 
Precipitation of the hydrated TiO2 is achieved by boiling the liquor for some hours followed by cooling to 60°C. At this stage of the process, the spenc acid with a concentration of 20-25% H2SO4 and 10-15% soluble salts (mainly iron, aluminium and mangesium sulfates) arises and is either recycled or neutralised with lime to produce gypsum which is preferntially sold at local markets as a commercial product.
6. Calcination: The rotary kilns are directly fired with oil or gas. Scrubbing calciner gas treatment has been upgraded in the past in order to reduce SO2 emissions. SO2 is normally reduced to form sulfuric acid and then recycled in the process. 
7. Finishing. The resulting solid is cooled, milled, coated, washed, dried and micronised.

niobium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"niobium mine operation and beneficiation, from pyrochlore ore",pyrochlore concentrate,BR,kilogram,"This dataset refers to the production of 1 kg of (refined) pyrochlore concentrate (63% beneficiated), as a result of the mining and beneficiation activities in Araxa, Brazil. 
Geography:  The Araxa carbonatite complex in Brasil is located about 6 km south of the city of Araxa in the state of Minas Gerais and serves as the largest known niobium reserve in the world. Since the 1960s, the complex has been mined by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao), being responsible today for more than 80% of the global niobium production. 
Technology:  Open-pit mining is applied and hydraulic excavators are used to extract the ore with different grades, which is transported to stockpiles awaiting homogenization through earth-moving equipment in order to attain the same concentration.
Conveyor belts (3.5 km) are utilized to transport the homogenized ore to the concentration unit.
Initially, the ore passes through a jaw crusher and moves to the ball mills, where the pyrochlore grains (1 mm average diameter) are reduced to diameters less than 0.104 mm. In the ball mills, recycled water is added in order to i) granulate the concentrate and ii) remove the gas from the sintering unit. The granulated ore undergoes i) magnetic separation, where magnetite is removed and is sold as a coproduct and ii) desliming in order to remove fractions smaller than 5μm by utilizing cyclones. Then the ore enters the flotation process - last stage of the beneficiation process – where the pyrochlore particles come into contact with flotation chemicals (hydrochloric & fluorosilic acid, triethylamene and lime), thereby removing the solid fractions and producing pyrochlore concentrate and barite as a coproduct which is also sold. The produced concentrate contains 55% Nb2O5 and 11% water and moves to the sintering unit, via tubes or is transported in bags while the separated and unused minerals enter the tailings dam.
In the sintering unit, the pyrochlore concentrate undergoes pelletizing, sintering, crushing and classification. These units not only accumulate the material but are also responsible for removing sulfur and water from the concentrate. Then the concentrate enters the dephosphorization unit, where phosphorus and lead are removed from the concentrate.

Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals. The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments. The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone. The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium. The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium.The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs). Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen. After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes. In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots. At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.
PLATINUM MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex. The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output. Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value. In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies. The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

Technology:  The ores from the different ore bodies are processed in concentrators where a PGM concentrate is produced with a tailing by product. The PGM base metal concentrate product from the different concentrators processing the different ores are blended during the smelting phase to balance the sulphur content in the final matte product. Smelter operators also carry out toll smelting from third part concentrators. The smelter product is send to the Base metal refinery where the PGMs are separated from the Base Metals. Precious metal refinery is carried out on PGM concentrate from the Base metal refinery to split the PGMs into individual metal products.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",AU,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Australia. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used in 'aluminium production Area 2' (North America) without Quebec for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from each individual grid within North America (using state-specific aluminium production capacity from US Geological Survey http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/aluminum/ and visual state-to-grid mapping) and  (2) ecoinvent v3.2 grid-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite.

Geography:  the electricity mix has been estimated
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
UNDERGROUND MINING:
Some ore bodies are more economically mined underground. In this case, a tunnel called an adit or a shaft is dug into the earth. Sort tunnels leading from the adit or shaft, called stopes, are dug to access the ore. The surface containing the ore, called a face, is drilled and loaded with explosives. Following blasting, the broken ore is loaded onto electric trucks and taken to the surface. Once mining is completed in a particular stope, it is backfilled with a cement compound. 
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
LEACHING:
The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks. 
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled. 
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.
REFINING:
Wohlwill electrolysis. It is assumed that the gold doré-bars from both mines undergo the treatment of Wohlwill electrolysis. This process uses an electrolyte containing 2.5 mol/l of HCl and 2 mol/l of HAuCl4 acid. Electrolysis is carried out with agitation at 65 – 75 °C. The raw gold is intro-duced as cast anode plates. The cathodes, on which the pure gold is deposited, were for many years made of fine gold of 0.25 mm thickness. These have now largely been replaced by sheet titanium or tantalum cathodes, from which the thick layer of fine gold can be peeled off. In a typical electrolysis cell, gold anodes weighing 12 kg and having dimensions 280×230×12 mm (0.138 m2 surface) are used. Opposite to them are conductively connected cathode plates, arranged by two or three on a support rail. One cell normally contains five or six cathode units and four or five anodes. The maximum cell voltage [V] is 1.5 V and the maximum anodic current density [A] 1500 A/m2. The South African Rand refinery gives a specific gold production rate of 0.2 kg per hour Wohlwill electrolysis. Assuming a current efficiency of 95% the energy consumption is [V] x [A] / 0.2 [kg/h] = 1.63 kWh per kg gold refined. No emissions are assumed because of the purity and the high value of the material processed. The resulting sludge contains the PGM present in the electric scrap and is sold for further processing.
WATER EMISSIONS:
Water effluents are discharged into rivers.

Technology:  Open-pit mining is applied and hydraulic excavators are used to extract the ore with different grades, which is transported to stockpiles awaiting homogenization through earth-moving equipment in order to attain the same concentration.
Conveyor belts (3.5 km) are utilized to transport the homogenized ore to the concentration unit.
Initially, the ore passes through a jaw crusher and moves to the ball mills, where the pyrochlore grains (1 mm average diameter) are reduced to diameters less than 0.104 mm. In the ball mills, recycled water is added in order to i) granulate the concentrate and ii) remove the gas from the sintering unit. The granulated ore undergoes i) magnetic separation, where magnetite is removed and is sold as a coproduct and ii) desliming in order to remove fractions smaller than 5μm by utilizing cyclones. Then the ore enters the flotation process - last stage of the beneficiation process – where the pyrochlore particles come into contact with flotation chemicals (hydrochloric & fluorosilic acid, triethylamene and lime), thereby removing the solid fractions and producing pyrochlore concentrate and barite as a coproduct which is also sold. The produced concentrate contains 55% Nb2O5 and 11% water and moves to the sintering unit, via tubes or is transported in bags while the separated and unused minerals enter the tailings dam.
In the sintering unit, the pyrochlore concentrate undergoes pelletizing, sintering, crushing and classification. These units not only accumulate the material but are also responsible for removing sulfur and water from the concentrate. Then the concentrate enters the dephosphorization unit, where phosphorus and lead are removed from the concentrate. The removal of sulphur and phosphorus have to be executed because of the local pyrochlore ore composition. Then the concentrate undergoes a carbothermic reduction by using charcoal and petroleum coke, producing a refined concentrate, 63% Nb2O5 and tailings with high lead content that are disposed in the tailings dam again.

Geography:  Average values of five European producers. The inventory is assumed to be representative of the global production.
Technology:  The present inventory uses by preference either high grade mineral ore rutile or an (artificially) upgraded ore - either via slag from a blast furnace or a synthetic rutile in which metals are leached out with dilute acid. The whole chloride process consists of the following sequential stages:
1. Raw material import and preparation: ore is sourced from outside Europe. An eventual (artifical) upgrade of the ore takes places at the quarry site of the primary ore. Before feeding the material into the TiO2 plant, the ore has to be dry - usually no drying is required. In case the moisture specification is exeeded, drying is done in flue-gas dryers. However, in the five here examined European plants, only one plant is using a drying system. Dry dust is thereby separated from the flue-gas by cyclones and filters and fed to the chlorinators. Feedstock of the required purity are purchased according to a set of specifications; specifications that are checked regularly.
2. Chlorination: ore containing TiO2 and coke are fed to a fluidised-bed reactor where an exothermic reactiion with chlorine gas takes place at 1000 °C. The primary reaction is: 2 TiO2 + 4 Cl2 + 3 C --> 2 TiCl4 + 2 CO + CO2. Impurities such as iron oxide will react in a similar manner (forming FeCl2 and CO). Impurities such as silica and zirconium do not chlorinate and may accumulate. The reactors may require total bed replacdement about once a year. In one plant, coke and unreacted bed material is separated and re-used.
3. Solid separation & waste solid metal chlorides treatment: The resulting vapour of TiCl4 plus other volatile metallic chloride impurities are cooled with recycled cold TiCl4, allowing the removal of some impurities. Solid metal chlorides are usually neutralised with lime which renders the residual metals insoluble before their disposal as a solid waste to landfill.
4. Condensation & Distillation: a majority of TiCl4 is condensed from the gas stream and pumped to a dedicated storage facility. More impurities and tetrachloride are removed from the gas stream by jet scrubbing with cold tetrachloride, which is also pumped to storage. The remaining gas stream is then passed for waste gas treatment (see below). Further purification of TiCl4 by distillation is carried out.
5. Oxidation: liquid TiCl4 and oxygen are preheated, then mixed. Oxidation of the TiCl4 to TiO2 and chlorine is carried out at between 900 and 1000 °C and 1500-2000 °C, in either a plasma arc furnace or in a toluene fired furnace, using oxygen injection. The overall reaction is TiCl4 + O2 --> TiO2 + 2 Cl2. This step is also used to control the final quality of the TiO2 crystal size to enable the product to be used as a pigment. Light metal chlorides are used to aid this process. The reaction products are cooled and the TiO2 powder is collected in bag filters and the chlorine recycled.
6. Cooling and separation: The product stream from the oxidation step is a mixture of chlorine, oxygen and TiO2 powder. After the exit from the reactor above, these are cooled by indirect water-cooling. TiO2 is slurried with water and transferred to the finishing stage (see below). Chlorine is separated in either of the following two ways: (i) absorption/desorption process - or (ii) direct recycling. In absorption/desorption process chain, the chlorine gas is drawn from the filters and then absorbed in liquid TiCl4 in an absorption column. This liquid is stored, whilst the tail-gases pass to a scrubber train, to remove residual chlorine. Chlorine is then recovered by desorption from the liquid TiCl4. The recycled chlorine is liquified and stored directly for the re-use. In the direct recycling process, the oxidation reactors are used at a higher pressure than the chlorinators - requiring however a precise synchronisation of the two process steps. 
7. Finishing. The resulting solid is cooled, milled, coated, washed, dried and micronised.

cadmium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,primary zinc production from concentrate,cadmium sludge from zinc electrolysis,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of high grade (SHG-Special High Grade) primary zinc by hydrometallurgical processes. Specific data were collected from the only producer in the Québec region, for the years 2011-2012.
Primary zinc is produced in the form of ingots and shot, respectively used as coating in steel work/die cast and for electroplating. About 25% of the produced zinc is in the form of an aluminium alloy.
The zinc concentrate, coming from all around the world (e.g. Canada (Québec and Ontario), Australia), is transported to the site by train or by ship and truck and mixed on site. The site is able to treate zinc concentrate contaminated with mercury and selenium but cannot recover silver and lead. Contrary to the GLO dataset, this dataset does not include waste contaning indium (""indium rich leaching residues, from zinc production"" by-product flow).
Geography:  This activity represents the production of primary zinc in the Québec region.
Technology:  Hydrometallurgical process
Sulphide concentrates are roasted first in fluidized bed roasters to produce zinc oxide (calcine) and sulphur dioxide. Roasting is an exothermic process and no additional fuel is used to sustain the reaction, the heat generated is recovered to produce steam. Calcine is then sent to the leaching step. Roaster gases are treated in hot electrostatics precipitators to remove dust. The remaining dust and volatile metals such as mercury and selenium are removed in the wet section of the acid plant through a cooling tour, a mist precipitator and a mercury tower (Boliden mercury removal processs). The sulphur dioxide is then converted to sulphuric acid in a conventional recovery system (converted and absorbing tower).
Leaching of the calcine is carried out in a number of successive stages using a gradually increasing strength of hot sulphuric acid. The initial stages dissolve the major part of the zinc oxide and the other stages dissolve the zinc ferrite (ZnO.Fe2O3) and convert iron into Jarosite (sodium Jarosite). Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) entering the electrolysis stage produce electrolyte (H2SO4) that is returned to leaching plant. Other metals are also dissolved during the process and are removed after leaching. Iron is the major impurity, which is precipitated in the form of Jarosite.
Overall waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several by-products, residues and wastes. Relatively large quantities of iron based solids, depending on the iron content, are generated by the leaching process (6.14E-1 kg Jarosite/kg zinc). Cement is added to the Jarosite to produce Jarofix (an inert waste). Solid residues also arise as the result of the liquid effluents treatment. The main waste stream is gypsum (CaSO4) and metal hydroxides that are produced at the wastewater neutralization plant. Mercury and selenium residues arise from the weak acid bleed treatment from the acid plant. Selenium can be recovered from these residues depending on the market demand for this metal.
Overall emissions: The emissions to air can either be stack emissions or fugitive emissions. Stack emissions are normally monitored continuously (SO2) or periodically (other emissions) and reported. The main emissions to air from zinc production are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matters including metals. Main emissions to water are metals and their compounds. The monitored metals are zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, copper and arsenic.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.', 'amount': 0.014, 'pedigree': {'reliability': 2, 'completeness': 1, 'temporal correlation': 1, 'geographical correlation': 1, 'further technological correlation': 1}, 'uncertainty type': 2, 'loc': -4.2687, 'scale': 0.20149441679609886, 'scale without pedigree': 0.2, 'name': 'fraction_PW_to_air'}, {'description': 'lifetime', 'id': '902d8a9c-c2b3-4b9e-855c-94bbe44f79db', 'unit': 'year', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.

Rough estimate extrapolated from Nickel, 99.5%, at plant dataset (ecoinvent v2.2), representing a global technology of 1994. This dataset is created only to complete Mining and benefication of nickel ore, QC dataset in order to provide a useful product (nickel). The amount of copper refined is calculated based on concentrate caracterisation (see dataset Mining and benefication of nickel ore, QC/GLO). Concerning the other metals in the concentrate (Co, AU, AG, Pt, Pd, Rh; see mining and benefication of nickel ore, QC dataset), since the dataset used for the extrapolation only produced Ni and Cu, no information are avalaible at that time to estimate the inputs associated with the refining of other metals.
Geography:  Extrapolated from a global nickel production dataset.
Technology:  Extrapolated from a typical technology for smelting and refining of nickel ore.
MINING:
95% of sulphidic nickel ores are mined underground in depths between 200m and 1800m, the ore is transferred to the beneficiation. Widening of the tunnels is mainly done by blasting. The overburden – material, which does not contain PGM-bearing ore – is deposed off-site and is partially refilled into the tunnels.
Emissions: The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. The underground mining operations generate roughly 80 % of the dust emissions from open pit operations, since the major dust sources do not take place underground. Rain percolate through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater.
Waste: Overburden is deposed close to the mine. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
BENEFICIATION:
After mining, the ore is first ground. In a next step it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metallic particles from the PGM-bearing minerals. After this first concentration step, flotation is carried out to remove the gangue from the sulphidic minerals. For neutralisation lime is added. In the flotation several organic chemicals are used as collector, frother, activator, depressor and flocculant. Sometimes cyanide is used as depressant for pyrite. Tailings usually are led to tailing heaps or ponds. As a result, nickel concentrates containing 7 - 25% Ni are produced.
Emissions: Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Flotation produce effluents containing several organic agents used. Some of these chemicals evaporate and account for VOC emissions to air. Namely xanthates decompose hydrolytically to release carbon disulphide. Tailings effluent contains additional sulphuric acid from acid rock drainage.
Waste: Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
METALLURGY AND REFINING:
There are many different process possibilities to win the metal. The chosen process depends on the composition of the ore, the local costs of energy carrier and the local legislation. Basically two different types can be distinguished: the hydrometallurgical and the pyrometallurgical process, which paired up with the refining processes, make up five major production routes (See Tab.1). All this routes are covered, aggregated according to their market share in 1994.
https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/00ebef53-ae97-400f-a602-7405e896cb76
Pyrometallurgy. The pyrometallurgical treatment of nickel concentrates includes three types of unit operation: roasting, smelting, and converting. In the roasting step sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide and part of the iron is oxidised. In smelting, the roaster product is melted with a siliceous flux which combines with the oxidised iron to produce two immiscible phases, a liquid silicate slag which can be discarded, and a solution of molten sulphides which contains the metal values. In the converting operation on the sulphide melt, more sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide, and the remaining iron is oxidised and fluxed for removal as silicate slag, leaving a high-grade nickel – copper sulphide matte. In several modern operations the roasting step has been eliminated, and the nickel sulphide concentrate is treated directly in the smelter.
Hydrometallurgy: Several hydrometallurgical processes are in commercial operation for the treatment of nickel – copper mattes to produce separate nickel and copper products. In addition, the hydrometal-lurgical process developed by Sherritt Gordon in the early 1950s for the direct treatment of nickel sulphide concentrates, as an alternative to smelting, is still commercially viable and competitive, despite very significant improvements in the economics and energy efficiency of nickel smelting technology. In a typical hydrometallurgical process, the concentrate or matte is first leached in a sulphate or chloride solution to dissolve nickel, cobalt, and some of the copper, while the sulphide is oxidised to insoluble elemental sulphur or soluble sulphate. Frequently, leaching is carried out in a two-stage countercurrent system so that the matte can be used to partially purify the solution, for example, by precipitating copper by cementation. In this way a nickel – copper matte can be treated in a two-stage leach process to produce a copper-free nickel sulphate or nickel chloride solution, and a leach residue enriched in copper.
Refining: In many applications, high-purity nickel is essential and Class I nickel products, which include electrolytic cathode, carbonyl powder, and hydrogen-reduced powder, are made by a variety of refining processes. The carbonyl refining process uses the property of nickel to form volatile nickel-carbonyl compounds from which elemental nickel subsides to form granules. Electrolytic nickel refineries treat cast raw nickel anodes in a electrolyte. Under current the anode dissolves and pure nickel deposits on the cathode. This electrorefining process is obsolete because of high energy demand and the necessity of building the crude nickel anode by reduction with coke. It is still practised in Russia. Most refineries recover electrolytic nickel by direct electrowinning from purified solutions produced by the leaching of nickel or nickel – copper mattes. Some companies recover refined nickel powder from purified ammoniacal solution by reduction with hydrogen.
Emissions: In all of the metallurgical steps, sulphur dioxide is emitted to air. Recovery of sulphur dioxide is only economic for high concentrated off-gas. Given that In the beneficiation step, considerable amounts of lime are added to the ore for pH-stabilisation, lime forms later flux in the metallurgical step, and decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carry over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to the air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Chlorine is used in some leaching stages and is produced during the subsequent electrolysis of chloride solution. The chlorine evolved is collected and re-used in the leach stage. The presence of chlorine in wastewater can lead to the formation of organic chlorine compounds (AOX) if solvents etc. are also present in a mixed wastewater. VOCs can be emitted from the solvent extraction stages. A variety of solvents are used an they contain various complexing agents to form complexes with the desired metal that are soluble in the organic layer. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Cu, Ni, Co, As and Cr. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages are the most important sources. The leaching stages are usually operated on a closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.
In the refining step, the combustion of sulphur leads to emissions of SO2. Nitrogen oxides are produced in significant amounts during acid digestion using nitric acid. Chlorine and HCl can be formed during a number of digestion, electrolytic and purification processes. Chlorine is used extensively in the Miller process and in the dissolution stages using hydrochloric acid and chlorine mixtrues respectively. Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Large quantities of effluents contain amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Regarding the metallurgical step, several co-products, residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue, are generated. Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds. In the refining step, quantities of solid residuals are also generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (ironhydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).

Geography:  Data for Germany are used in this module for Europe. Some agents used like lime or  transport originate from data sets are valid only for Switzerland.
Technology:  The production process consists of three steps: Collection, Beneficiation and Refining. 
COLLECTION:
Spoiled automotive catalysts are bought by specialised enterprises from different origins. Part of it originates from scrap dealer recycling end-of-life cars. Further more during the cars operating phase, defective catalysts are exchanged in garages. The third sources is the production waste, i. e. defective catalysts which do not reach market. In most cases, there are fix agreements between the different supplier and the intermediary trade. Although the trade with PGM containing scrap is risky. Motor car manufacturer built up their own internal recycling systems with their contractor garages and gained access to exchanged catalysts.
Emissions: Emissions during collection are gases from transportation and dust from dismantling. Also in this step the combustion leads to emissions of SO2. No serious water emissions are reported. 
BENEFICIATION:
The catalysts are dismantled and then sold to refining companies. Refineries too have long-term contracts with the intermediary trade.
Emissions: Emissions during beneficiation are gases from transportation and dust from dismantling. Also in this step the combustion leads to emissions of SO2. No serious water emissions are reported. 
REFINING:
The scrap first is shredded and then pyrometallurgicaly processed: The scrap is smelted in an electric arc furnace, and the ceramic wafer is slagged. The PGMs are concentrated in the collector metal, usually copper. Low-content PGM scrap is often smelted together with other non-ferrous metal matte. This is cheap, but effects a high loss in PGM. The collector matte from the furnace then is treated hydrometallurgically by re-precipitation. In this step usually production scrap from other industries (glass, chemical laboratories) is joined. The overall PGM-yield is 98 % for platinum and 85 % for rhodium.
Emissions: Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Effluents from refining contain considerable amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Solid residues from pyrometallurgical step are usually re-used in copper facilities, final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes.

titanium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,titanium production,titanium,GLO,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of titanium. Primary titanium metal is produced mainly by the Kroll process, which produces purified titanium sponge. The titanium sponge can then be refined using vacuum arc remelting. This dataset models the vacuum arc remelting step. The previous steps are modelled in the titanium tetrachloride production dataset and the titanium sponge production dataset.
Technology:  Primary titanium metal is produced mainly by Kroll process.  In this batch process, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is reduced with magnesium under inert atmosphere creating a sponge like titanium metal solid which is refined by vaccum arc remelting. The Kroll process is characterized by multiple steps for which many are energy and labor intensive. Main steps include batch reduction, processing, vaccum distillation and remelting. Main batch reduction takes place in a steel reactor filled with argon where the magnesium is melt at temperature between 850°C-950°C. The titanium chloride (TiCl4) is fed, or blown in as vapor, into the reactor. The reduction is a highly exothermic reaction, thus little energy input is required for it to take place. Reaction is as follow: TiCl4(l or g)  +  2 Mg(l)  = Ti(s)  +  2 MgCl2(l). During the processing the reaction by-product, molten magnesium chloride (MgCl2), is remove from the reator periodically during the reaction. The magnesium and clhoride from this by-product are recovered using electrolysis and re-used. Main product from the process is a sponge like titanium (Ti(0)). Vaccum distillation is then use to purified the crude sponge removing residual metal chlorides and magnesium. This process takes place at temperature between 900°C and 1000°C. The residuals are recovered by condensation. The purified titanium sponge is refined using vacuum arc remelting.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from nuclear used for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting) in the region. The dataset also identifies the technology and grids providing the electricity from nuclear power plants. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using pressure water reactors, boiling water reactors and pressure water reactor, heavy water moderated is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of nuclear electricity coming from each individual grid within North America (using state-specific aluminium production capacity from US Geological Survey http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/aluminum/ and visual state-to-grid mapping) and  (2) ecoinvent v3.2 grid-specific split of coal power plants between nuclear power plant technologies. As there are no regional datasets for pressure water reactor, heavy water moderated, all nuclear coming from this technology is linked to the GLO dataset.
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

Synthetic rutile is produced by reducing the iron oxide in ilmenite to metallic iron using carbon monoxide, followed by reoxidation and separation from the TiO2 rich fraction - the Becher process - or leaching with hydrochloric acid - the Benelite process. This activity describes synthetic rutile production using the Benelite process, which is only known to be used in India.
Technology:  The production of synthetic rutile from ilmenite by its leaching with hydrochloric acid. The amounts of materials both on the input and on the output are calculated using stoichiometric equation relations. In order to produce 1 kg of  rutile (95% TiO2, i.e. 0.95 kg of TiO2), 1.687 kg of titanium oxochloride (TiOCl2) is needed and 0.867 kg of hydrochloric acid is produced as by-product. 95% of this hydrochloric acid is recycled and returned back to the process. In order to produce 1.687 kg of oxochloride (TiOCl2), 1.922 kg of hydrochloride acid (HCl) and 2 kg of ilmenite (FeTiO3) is needed. When the recycled amount of hydrochloric acid is deducted the make-up amount is then (1.922-0.867*0.95=) 1.098kg.

Reference: ""The Environmental Performance of Refined Cobalt - Life Cycle Inventory and Life Cycle Assessment of Refined Cobalt - Summary Report"", CDI & ERM, Novermber 2016. PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

In- and outputs of Al(OH)3 are calculated according to the stoichiometry (1.530 kg Al(OH)3 --> 1.000 kg Al2O3 + 0.530 kg H2O). Separate energy data was provided by IAI for production of hydrate and calcination processes. The Al(OH)3 extraction process involves adding milled bauxite to a hot caustic soda (NaOH) solution, dissolving the aluminium-bearing minerals (gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore) present to form a sodium aluminate supersaturated solution or “pregnant liquor”. Flocculants are added to aid settling and the solution is progressively cooled causing aluminium hydroxide crystals to precipitate. Further information can be found at http://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/refining/process.html.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore",sulfuric acid,CL,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in Chile.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold production,gold,US,kilogram,"This dataset describes the production 1 kg of gold, at plant.  Data was taken from the following US gold-only mines: Bald Mountain, Cortez, Golden Sunlight, Goldstrike and Round Mountain (as in the 2006 Environmental report of Barrick), and Nevada and Golden Giant (as in the 2005 Environmental report of Newmont). Data for reference flows, by products and most exchanges was calculated by piling up the corresponding amounts of inputs and outputs of each mine, and then scaling the piled amounts to the production of 1 kg of gold. Barrick mines were previously owned by Placer Dome to Barrick, thus previous environmental reports of Placer Dome Inc. (2002) are used as well. Mines are either open ground or underground.
Geography:  Material requirements for gold concentration are estimated with Australian data, emissions to water and air are estimated with Australian data
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
UNDERGROUND MINING:
Some ore bodies are more economically mined underground. In this case, a tunnel called an adit or a shaft is dug into the earth. Sort tunnels leading from the adit or shaft, called stopes, are dug to access the ore. The surface containing the ore, called a face, is drilled and loaded with explosives. Following blasting, the broken ore is loaded onto electric trucks and taken to the surface. Once mining is completed in a particular stope, it is backfilled with a cement compound. 
BENEFICIATION:
Bald Mountain Mines: The ore treatment method is based on conventional heap leaching technology followed by carbon absorption. The loaded carbon is stripped and refined in the newly commissioned refinery on site. Water is supplied by wells located on the mine property. Grid power was brought to Bald Mountain Mine in 1996. For this purpose, one 27-kilometre 69 KVA power line was constructed from the Alligator Ridge Mine substation to the grid.
Golden Sunlight Mines: The ore treatment plant is based on conventional carbon-in-pulp technology, with the addition of a Sand Tailings Retreatment (STR) gold recovery plant to recover gold that would otherwise be lost to tailings. The STR circuit removes the heavier gold bearing pyrite from the sand portion of the tailings by gravity separation. The gold is refined into doré at the mine. Tailing from the mill is discharged to an impoundment area where the solids are allowed to settle so the water can be reused. A cyanide recovery/destruction process was commissioned in 1998. It eliminates the hazard posed to wildlife at the tailings impoundment by lowering cyanide concentrations below 20 mg/l. Fresh water for ore processing, dust suppression, and fire control is supplied from the Jefferson Slough, which is an old natural channel of the Jefferson River. Ore processing also uses water pumped from the tailings impoundment. Pit water is treated in a facility located in the mill complex prior to disposal or for use in dust control. Drinking water is made available by filtering fresh water through an on-site treatment plant. Electric power is provided from a substation at the south property boundary. North-Western Energy supplies electricity the substation. Small diesel generators are used for emergency lighting. A natural gas pipeline supplies gas for heating buildings, a crusher, air scrubber, boiler, carbon reactivation kiln, and refining furnaces.
Cortez Mine: Three different metallurgical processes are employed for the recovery of gold. The process used for a particular ore is determined based on grade and metallurgical character of that ore. Lower grade oxide ore is heap leached, while higher-grade non-refractory ore is treated in a conventional mill using cyanidation and a carbon-in-leach (“CIL”) process. When carbonaceous ore is processed by Barrick, it is first dry ground, and then oxidized in a circulating fluid bed roaster, followed by CIL recovery. In 2002 a new leach pad and process plant was commissioned; this plant is capable of processing 164 million tonnes of heap leach ore over the life of the asset. Heap leach ore production is hauled directly to heap leach pads for gold recovery. Water for process use is supplied from the open pit dewatering system. Approximately 90 litres per second of the pit dewatering volume is diverted for plant use. Electric power is supplied by Sierra Pacific Power Company (“SPPC”) through a 73 kilometre, 120 kV transmission line. A long-term agreement is in place with SPPC to provide power through the regulated power system. The average power requirement of the mine is about 160 GWh/year.
REFINING:
Wohlwill electrolysis. It is assumed that the gold doré-bars from both mines undergo the treatment of Wohlwill electrolysis. This process uses an electrolyte containing 2.5 mol/l of HCl and 2 mol/l of HAuCl4 acid. Electrolysis is carried out with agitation at 65 – 75 °C. The raw gold is intro-duced as cast anode plates. The cathodes, on which the pure gold is deposited, were for many years made of fine gold of 0.25 mm thickness. These have now largely been replaced by sheet titanium or tantalum cathodes, from which the thick layer of fine gold can be peeled off. In a typical electrolysis cell, gold anodes weighing 12 kg and having dimensions 280×230×12 mm (0.138 m2 surface) are used. Opposite to them are conductively connected cathode plates, arranged by two or three on a support rail. One cell normally contains five or six cathode units and four or five anodes. The maximum cell voltage [V] is 1.5 V and the maximum anodic current density [A] 1500 A/m2. The South African Rand refinery gives a specific gold production rate of 0.2 kg per hour Wohlwill electrolysis. Assuming a current efficiency of 95% the energy consumption is [V] x [A] / 0.2 [kg/h] = 1.63 kWh per kg gold refined. No emissions are assumed because of the purity and the high value of the material processed. The resulting sludge contains the PGM present in the electric scrap and is sold for further processing.

WATER EMISSIONS:

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore","copper concentrate, sulfide ore",AU,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in Australia.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Geography:  This dataset is valid for the whole corresponding region. Some agents used, such as lime and sodium cynaide, originate from datasets value for Switzerland or Europe. Processes such as blasting originate from datasets value for Switzerland or Europe. Exchanges amounts calculated based on country-specific average ore grade (as reported in Northey et al. 2014)
Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

Geography:  Extrapolated from a global nickel production dataset.
Technology:  Extrapolated from a typical technology for smelting and refining of nickel ore.
MINING:
95% of sulphidic nickel ores are mined underground in depths between 200m and 1800m, the ore is transferred to the beneficiation. Widening of the tunnels is mainly done by blasting. The overburden – material, which does not contain PGM-bearing ore – is deposed off-site and is partially refilled into the tunnels.
Emissions: The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. The underground mining operations generate roughly 80 % of the dust emissions from open pit operations, since the major dust sources do not take place underground. Rain percolate through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater.
Waste: Overburden is deposed close to the mine. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
BENEFICIATION:
After mining, the ore is first ground. In a next step it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metallic particles from the PGM-bearing minerals. After this first concentration step, flotation is carried out to remove the gangue from the sulphidic minerals. For neutralisation lime is added. In the flotation several organic chemicals are used as collector, frother, activator, depressor and flocculant. Sometimes cyanide is used as depressant for pyrite. Tailings usually are led to tailing heaps or ponds. As a result, nickel concentrates containing 7 - 25% Ni are produced.
Emissions: Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Flotation produce effluents containing several organic agents used. Some of these chemicals evaporate and account for VOC emissions to air. Namely xanthates decompose hydrolytically to release carbon disulphide. Tailings effluent contains additional sulphuric acid from acid rock drainage.
Waste: Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
METALLURGY AND REFINING:
There are many different process possibilities to win the metal. The chosen process depends on the composition of the ore, the local costs of energy carrier and the local legislation. Basically two different types can be distinguished: the hydrometallurgical and the pyrometallurgical process, which paired up with the refining processes, make up five major production routes (See Tab.1). All this routes are covered, aggregated according to their market share in 1994.
https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/00ebef53-ae97-400f-a602-7405e896cb76
Pyrometallurgy. The pyrometallurgical treatment of nickel concentrates includes three types of unit operation: roasting, smelting, and converting. In the roasting step sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide and part of the iron is oxidised. In smelting, the roaster product is melted with a siliceous flux which combines with the oxidised iron to produce two immiscible phases, a liquid silicate slag which can be discarded, and a solution of molten sulphides which contains the metal values. In the converting operation on the sulphide melt, more sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide, and the remaining iron is oxidised and fluxed for removal as silicate slag, leaving a high-grade nickel – copper sulphide matte. In several modern operations the roasting step has been eliminated, and the nickel sulphide concentrate is treated directly in the smelter.
Hydrometallurgy: Several hydrometallurgical processes are in commercial operation for the treatment of nickel – copper mattes to produce separate nickel and copper products. In addition, the hydrometal-lurgical process developed by Sherritt Gordon in the early 1950s for the direct treatment of nickel sulphide concentrates, as an alternative to smelting, is still commercially viable and competitive, despite very significant improvements in the economics and energy efficiency of nickel smelting technology. In a typical hydrometallurgical process, the concentrate or matte is first leached in a sulphate or chloride solution to dissolve nickel, cobalt, and some of the copper, while the sulphide is oxidised to insoluble elemental sulphur or soluble sulphate. Frequently, leaching is carried out in a two-stage countercurrent system so that the matte can be used to partially purify the solution, for example, by precipitating copper by cementation. In this way a nickel – copper matte can be treated in a two-stage leach process to produce a copper-free nickel sulphate or nickel chloride solution, and a leach residue enriched in copper.
Refining: In many applications, high-purity nickel is essential and Class I nickel products, which include electrolytic cathode, carbonyl powder, and hydrogen-reduced powder, are made by a variety of refining processes. The carbonyl refining process uses the property of nickel to form volatile nickel-carbonyl compounds from which elemental nickel subsides to form granules. Electrolytic nickel refineries treat cast raw nickel anodes in a electrolyte. Under current the anode dissolves and pure nickel deposits on the cathode. This electrorefining process is obsolete because of high energy demand and the necessity of building the crude nickel anode by reduction with coke. It is still practised in Russia. Most refineries recover electrolytic nickel by direct electrowinning from purified solutions produced by the leaching of nickel or nickel – copper mattes. Some companies recover refined nickel powder from purified ammoniacal solution by reduction with hydrogen.
Emissions: In all of the metallurgical steps, sulphur dioxide is emitted to air. Recovery of sulphur dioxide is only economic for high concentrated off-gas. Given that In the beneficiation step, considerable amounts of lime are added to the ore for pH-stabilisation, lime forms later flux in the metallurgical step, and decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carry over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to the air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Chlorine is used in some leaching stages and is produced during the subsequent electrolysis of chloride solution. The chlorine evolved is collected and re-used in the leach stage. The presence of chlorine in wastewater can lead to the formation of organic chlorine compounds (AOX) if solvents etc. are also present in a mixed wastewater. VOCs can be emitted from the solvent extraction stages. A variety of solvents are used an they contain various complexing agents to form complexes with the desired metal that are soluble in the organic layer. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Cu, Ni, Co, As and Cr. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages are the most important sources. The leaching stages are usually operated on a closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.
In the refining step, the combustion of sulphur leads to emissions of SO2. Nitrogen oxides are produced in significant amounts during acid digestion using nitric acid. Chlorine and HCl can be formed during a number of digestion, electrolytic and purification processes. Chlorine is used extensively in the Miller process and in the dissolution stages using hydrochloric acid and chlorine mixtrues respectively. Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Large quantities of effluents contain amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Regarding the metallurgical step, several co-products, residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue, are generated. Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds. In the refining step, quantities of solid residuals are also generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (ironhydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold mine operation and refining,gold,SE,kilogram,"This dataset was created by merging two separate multi-output datasets from ecoinvent database v2; ""mining, gold-silver-zinc-lead-copper deposit"" and ""refining, copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver, in smelter"".
This dataset describes the joint production of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Both mining and refining are included in this activity. The data on mining corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals. Data quality for emissions into air / water, as well as disposal of tailings, is low. Regarding the refining; gold and silver are supposed to be treated in the PGM plant in Rönnskär, whereas the other metals are supposed to undergo other treatments. A high share of the production is recycled metal, e.g. 74% for gold.
Geography:  Energy use and emissions during the mining are from Swedish mines. Material requirements during refinery for gold and silver are estimated with Australian data, cyanide consumption is estimated with US-Data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
HEAP LEACHING:
The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks.
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled.
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore","copper concentrate, sulfide ore",ID,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in Indonesia.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",RoW,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Electrometallurgical zinc smelting includes roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, melting, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. Pyrometallurgical zinc smelting includes sintering, leaching, refining, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset.

Geography:  This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. 
The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.
Image: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/5fe963ea-10cc-44e7-a6a9-b8b4871bc917
Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. 
Electrometallurgical Smelting
The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).
Pyro-metallurgical Smelting
The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 & 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then. Moreover, the technology has not changed significantly in the time period between 2012 and 2019 and therefore this data is considered to be appropriate in modeling current zinc production.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Literature value.

Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

In- and outputs of Al(OH)3 are calculated according to the stoichiometry (1.530 kg Al(OH)3 --> 1.000 kg Al2O3 + 0.530 kg H2O). Separate energy data was provided by IAI for production of hydrate and calcination processes. The Al(OH)3 extraction process involves adding milled bauxite to a hot caustic soda (NaOH) solution, dissolving the aluminium-bearing minerals (gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore) present to form a sodium aluminate supersaturated solution or “pregnant liquor”. Flocculants are added to aid settling and the solution is progressively cooled causing aluminium hydroxide crystals to precipitate.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,cobalt production,"copper, cathode",GLO,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of cobalt by the global cobalt industry. Reference: ""The Environmental Performance of Refined Cobalt - Life Cycle Inventory and Life Cycle Assessment of Refined Cobalt - Summary Report"", CDI & ERM, Novermber 2016. PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"electrorefining of copper, anode","copper, cathode",GLO,kilogram,"For the electrorefining of copper anodes to produce high grade copper cathodes, globally.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere were calculated based on the LCI process model for “copper production, primary” described in Classen et al. (2009) for ecoinvent v2.1. The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Further information is provided in the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs.

Electrometallurgical zinc smelting includes roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, melting, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. Pyrometallurgical zinc smelting includes sintering, leaching, refining, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset.

Geography:  This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. 
The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.
Image: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/5fe963ea-10cc-44e7-a6a9-b8b4871bc917
Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. 
Electrometallurgical Smelting
The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).
Pyro-metallurgical Smelting
The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 & 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then.

Aluminium industry specific markets are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located.

cadmium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,primary zinc production from concentrate,cadmium sludge from zinc electrolysis,RoW,kilogram,"The multi-output ""primary zinc production from concentrate"" process includes all steps required to produce special high grade zinc from zinc concentrate using the electrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical (less common) processes. Electrometallurgical zinc smelting includes roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, melting, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. Pyrometallurgical zinc smelting includes sintering, leaching, refining, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset. 
The below images present the system boundary in relation to the primary product, special high grade zinc.

Geography:  This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. 
The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.
Image: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/5fe963ea-10cc-44e7-a6a9-b8b4871bc917
Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. 
Electrometallurgical Smelting
The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).
Pyro-metallurgical Smelting
The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 & 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then. Moreover, the technology has not changed significantly in the time period between 2012 and 2019 and therefore this data is considered to be appropriate in modeling current zinc production.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Literature value.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore","copper concentrate, sulfide ore",ZM,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in Zambia.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

Geography:  Material requirements are estimated with Australian data, Air emissions are estimated with Swedish data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
HEAP LEACHING:
The recovery processes of the Misima Mine are cyanide leach and carbon in pulp (CIP). The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: The recovery process in the Porgera Mine is pressure oxidation and cyanide leach. The slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks. 
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled. 
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.
WATER SUPPLY:
For Misima Mine, process water is supplied from pit dewatering bores and in-pit water. Potable water is sourced from boreholes in the coastal limestone.
For Porgera Mine, the main water supply of the mine is the Waile Creek Dam, located approximately 7 kilometres from the mine. The reservoir has a capacity of approximately 717, 000 m3 of water. Water for the grinding circuit is also extracted from Kogai Creek, which is located adjacent to the grinding circuit. The mine operates four water treatment plants for potable water and five sewage treatment plants.
ENERGY SUPPLY:
For Misima Mine, electricity is produced by the mine on site or with own power generators, from diesel and heavy fuel oil.
For Porgera Mine, electricity is produced by the mine on site. Assumed with Mobius / Wohlwill electrolysis. Porgera's principal source of power is supplied by a 73-kilometre transmission line from the gas fired and PJV-owned Hides Power Station. The station has a total output of 62 megawatts (“MW”). A back up diesel power station is located at the mine and has an output of 13MW. The average power requirement of the mine is about 60 MW. 
For both Misima and Porgera Mines, an 18 MW diesel fired power station supplies electrical power. Diesel was used in the station due to the unavailability of previously supplied heavy fuel oil.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold-silver mine operation with refinery,gold,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset describes the production of gold and silver in Quebec (Canada) in 2012. This includes the operations at the mining site located in Quebec, i.e. mining, benefication and a first refining, which leads to the production of doré bars, containing gold, silver and impurities. 
Specific data were collected from 3 mines that produced doré bars in Quebec. These mines represent about 98% of Quebec gold production and about 95% of Quebec silver production from combined gold-silver mines. Share is estimated as the production statistics for 2012-2013 are not published yet and considers gold-silver mines only (not gold and silver coming from other mines). One mine is an open-pit mine and the two others are underground. A weighted average of 839 tonnes of ore is extracted per kg of gold produce. The recovery rate of gold is known for two of the mines (89% and 91%) and the recovery rate of silver known for only one mine (76%). 
Note that the mine infrastructure are extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset, where the modelled mines are open pit. This is not representative of the Quebec situation where two of the three modelled mine are underground. Thus a mine infrastrucuture, gold and silver, Québec will eventually be created in order to reflect the Québec specificity. 
In order to create a dataset with gold and silver as outputs (to comply with the boundaries of the GLO dataset), a very simplified modeling of the refining of the doré bars to produce gold and silver has been added to this dataset although it is done in Ontario (Canada) : electricity use is extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, PE and PG datasets and infrastructure extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset. 
It is assume that the refining efficency is 100% (i.e. no loss of gold).
Geography:  Inputs and outputs for mining, benefication and a first refining relate to Quebec production. Inputs for doré bar refining, which is done in Ontario, are extrapolated from dataset gold-silver mine operation with refinery (PG, CL, SE).

Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is used in thin film solar cells as a junction partner in CIS (Copper-Indium-Diselenid) and Cd/Te solar cells. The CdS layer itself is not intended to absorb light but instead allows light to pass through to either the CIS or CdTe substrate. Therefore, the CdS layer must be thin (30 to 100 nanometre) in order to allow sufficient light to pass through. A purity of at least 99.99% (4N) is required. 
CdS is also used as pigment, that is valued for its good thermal stability in many polymers, for example in engineering plastics. By adding selenium in its formula it is possible to obtain colours ranging from a greenish yellow to red violet. Pigments do not necessarily need a purity as high as for solar cells.

Geography:  Production in US. The data are assumed to be representative of the global production.
Technology:  Production of cadmium sulfide by the hydrometallurgical process. This aqueous technique of producing CdS involves a number of handling steps and is a complex procedure. According to a patent, the normal procedure is to “dissolve a cadmium salt in water, preferably the chloride or sulphate, and then bubble hydrogen sulfide through the solution to precipitate essentially all of the cadmium in the form of cadmium sulfide.” The reported yield is quite high; anionic and cationic impurities co-precipitates with the cadmium sulfide. The following purification involves extensive washing and leaching, until a high purity of the output product can be obtained.

PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"electrorefining of copper, anode","anode slime from electrorefining of copper, anode",GLO,kilogram,"For the electrorefining of copper anodes to produce high grade copper cathodes, globally.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere were calculated based on the LCI process model for “copper production, primary” described in Classen et al. (2009) for ecoinvent v2.1. The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Further information is provided in the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold mine operation and refining,silver,SE,kilogram,"This dataset was created by merging two separate multi-output datasets from ecoinvent database v2; ""mining, gold-silver-zinc-lead-copper deposit"" and ""refining, copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver, in smelter"".
This dataset describes the joint production of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Both mining and refining are included in this activity. The data on mining corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals. Data quality for emissions into air / water, as well as disposal of tailings, is low. Regarding the refining; gold and silver are supposed to be treated in the PGM plant in Rönnskär, whereas the other metals are supposed to undergo other treatments. A high share of the production is recycled metal, e.g. 74% for gold.
Geography:  Energy use and emissions during the mining are from Swedish mines. Material requirements during refinery for gold and silver are estimated with Australian data, cyanide consumption is estimated with US-Data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
HEAP LEACHING:
The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks.
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled.
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",AU,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Australia. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

The electrolysis of magnesium chloride separates the magnesium from the chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2. The recovered Mg is fed back to the reduction and distillation process (which produces titanium sponge) and the chlorine is fed back to the chlorination and refining process (which produces titanium tetrachloride).
This dataset is a copy of the dataset covering the geography of China (CN), which is based on Gao et al. (2018). The data is assumed to be representative also of the Japanese situation, since the Kroll process is the most commonly used method for the production of titanium sponge.

Geography:  The dataset has been approximated from the respective dataset for CN. The data is assumed to be representative also of the Japanese situation.
Technology:  The reduction and distillation step of the Kroll process produces titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2.
After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.
According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.
Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.
Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.
0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.

titanium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,heavy mineral sand quarry operation,"rutile, 95% titanium dioxide",RoW,kilogram,"Geography:  As mentioned in the general comment,  the dataset is meant to be a global average representation of the zircon sand production (data taken from 8 companies including 10 production sites, covering all major producing countries – Australia, South Africa, Kenya, Senegal and USA) representing 77% of the global situation.
Technology:  There are two ways for mining zircon sand: dry & wet mining with the choice of mining depending on the structure of the geological deposit. During wet mining, floating dredges and a floating concentrator are utilized in an enclosed pond, where the concentrator moves behind the dredges. Wet mining is the preferred technique for large continuous deposits with amounts of clay. 
For all other types of HMS deposits (hard-ground deposits, discontinuous deposits and small tonnage high-grade deposits), dry mining is the most preferred mining process. Dry mining utilizes earth-moving machinery (loaders, excavators, scrapes) for the purposes of sand excavation and transportation to the concentrator. The mining unit plants used in dry mining are mobile in order to minimize the transport distance of the sand. 
After the transportation of the HMS to the respective concentrator, wet gravity separations techniques (spirals) are usually applied for the production of the heavy mineral concentrate (HMC), although some hard-rock sites use bulk froth flotation to extract the heavy minerals from the sand. The produced slurry from dry and wet mining is then fed to the concentrator, where the HMC (90-96% heavy minerals) is produced along with the tailings that are backfilled in the mined areas. The HMC is transported to a mineral separation plant (MSP), where the HMC is subjected to scrubbing, drying and is separated by magnetic, electrostatic and gravity separation, producing zircon sand, ilmenite and rutile, with the last two considered as byproducts.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used in 'aluminium production Area 7' (Oceania) for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from Australia and New Zealand; and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite. The share of coal electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total coal electricity used in aluminium production in the region as reported by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: IAI personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal types used in coal power plants for Australia.

Rand Refinery is the refining hub for Africa and increasingly beyond. It was established in 1920 to refine gold within South Africa which until that time had been refined in London.

Technology:  REFINING: The refinery, which provides a same day refining service, employs the widely used Miller Chlorination Process to upgrade the gold bullion it receives from mines to at least 99.50% fine gold, the minimum standard required for gold sold on the world bullion markets. It also employs the world’s leading silver refining technology. To further refine gold and silver to 99.99% the cost-effective once-through Wohlwill electrolytic refining process is used.
MILLER CHLORINATION PROCESS: This is a pyrometallurgical process whereby gold dore is heated in furnace crucibles. The process is able to separate gold from impurities by using chlorine gas which is added to the crucibles once the gold is molten. Chlorine gas does not react with gold but will combine with silver and base metals to form chlorides. Once the chlorides have formed they float to the surface as slag or escape as volatile gases. The surface melt and the fumes containing the impurities are collected and further refined to extract the gold and silver. 
This process can take up to 90 minutes produces gold which is at least 99.5% pure with silver being the main remaining component. This gold can be cast into bars as 99.5% gold purity meets the minimum London Good Delivery. However some customers such as jewellers and other industrial end users require gold that is almost 100% pure, so further refining is necessary. In this case, gold using the Miller process is cast into anodes which are then sent to an electrolytic plant. The final product is 99.99% pure gold sponge that can then be melted to produce various end products suited to the needs of the customer.
WOHLWILL PROCESS - The electrolytic method of gold refining was first developed by Dr. Emil Wohlwill of Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg in 1874. Dr. Wohlwill’s process is based on the solubility of gold but the insolubility of silver in an electrolyte solution of gold chloride (AuCl3) in hydrochloric acid.

Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport.

Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals. The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments. The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone. The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium. The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium.The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs). Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen. After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes. In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots. At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.
PLATINUM MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex. The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output. Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value. In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies. The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

Technology:  The ores from the different ore bodies are processed in concentrators where a PGM concentrate is produced with a tailing by product. The PGM base metal concentrate product from the different concentrators processing the different ores are blended during the smelting phase to balance the sulphur content in the final matte product. Smelter operators also carry out toll smelting from third part concentrators. The smelter product is send to the Base metal refinery where the PGMs are separated from the Base Metals. Precious metal refinery is carried out on PGM concentrate from the Base metal refinery to split the PGMs into individual metal products.

aluminium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"aluminium production, primary, ingot","aluminium, primary, ingot","IAI Area, Africa",kilogram,"The dataset represents the production of 1kg of primary aluminium ingot. Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore",sulfuric acid,CN,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in China.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

Hence the radioactive emissions (and spectrum) as well as the radioactive solid waste may have been somewhat underestimated. Data for the operation of a nuclear fuel fabrication facility are relatively old but emissions to water are complete for a US plant. Radioactive emissions to air and water have been taken or derived from two commercial German facilities: both (one operational, the other closed) exhibit emissions per unit of product fuel much lower than data published in the 1980s. An average value of the two plants is used. Zirconium for cladding is modelled as chromium, for lack of complete information on its metallurgical process; the uncertainty value reflects only the amount. This module is linked with one enrichment module with specific characteristics for the mix or enrichment processes and electricity supply mix; hence, before using the cumulated results of this module the conditions for enrichment should be verified.

The pozzolanic reaction is slow compared with Ordinary Portland cement hydration; therefore, heat liberation and strength development are slow in concrete. The pozzolanic reaction is very efficient in filling up concrete pores, improving strength and impermeability of concrete. Pozzolans can be natural materials, such as volcanic stones with natural pozzolanic activity/; or artificial materials, including manufactured products (e.g. calcined clay) or byproducts from other industries (e.g. fly ash from coal thermal power plants).
Six types of Portland and blended cement types represent Brazilian production. The table below presents the different cement types and compositions according to Brazilian standards (NBR 11578:1991, NBR 5735:1991, NBR 5736:1991, NBR 5733:1991).
The CP II cement types are the most consumed cement in Brazil. CP II represents 62.1% of the market according to the National Union of the Cement Industry (SNIC, 2013). Its applications range from reinforced and ordinary concrete to coating mortars. This cement provides a slower rate of hydration heat emission than ordinary Portland Cement. Properties attained by using low pozzolanic content in concrete are less permeability, ionic diffusivity, capillary porosity, which increase stability and durability. The CP II-Z cement consists of clinker, calcium sulfate, milled limestone and 6-14% pozzolana and fly ash. (see composition in the table).
This dataset contains information from clinker stockpile to cement ready to be shipped in bulk. After the clinker is cooled from the rotary kiln, it is ground in ball or roller mills to particles under 75 μm size. Then it goes to silos where it is mixed with calcium sulphate (gypsum) and SCMs. The mixed cement goes to a finishing mill and then it is stored in cement silos, ready to be shipped in bulk or packed.
This dataset uses “hard coal ash” as a proxy for fly ash, ""silica sand"" as a proxy for natural pozzolans and ""nickel smelter slag"" as a proxy for slags from metallurgical processes of nickel, copper and manganese.

Geography:  Extrapolated from a global nickel production dataset.
Technology:  Extrapolated from a typical technology for smelting and refining of nickel ore.
MINING:
95% of sulphidic nickel ores are mined underground in depths between 200m and 1800m, the ore is transferred to the beneficiation. Widening of the tunnels is mainly done by blasting. The overburden – material, which does not contain PGM-bearing ore – is deposed off-site and is partially refilled into the tunnels.
Emissions: The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. The underground mining operations generate roughly 80 % of the dust emissions from open pit operations, since the major dust sources do not take place underground. Rain percolate through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater.
Waste: Overburden is deposed close to the mine. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
BENEFICIATION:
After mining, the ore is first ground. In a next step it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metallic particles from the PGM-bearing minerals. After this first concentration step, flotation is carried out to remove the gangue from the sulphidic minerals. For neutralisation lime is added. In the flotation several organic chemicals are used as collector, frother, activator, depressor and flocculant. Sometimes cyanide is used as depressant for pyrite. Tailings usually are led to tailing heaps or ponds. As a result, nickel concentrates containing 7 - 25% Ni are produced.
Emissions: Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Flotation produce effluents containing several organic agents used. Some of these chemicals evaporate and account for VOC emissions to air. Namely xanthates decompose hydrolytically to release carbon disulphide. Tailings effluent contains additional sulphuric acid from acid rock drainage.
Waste: Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
METALLURGY AND REFINING:
There are many different process possibilities to win the metal. The chosen process depends on the composition of the ore, the local costs of energy carrier and the local legislation. Basically two different types can be distinguished: the hydrometallurgical and the pyrometallurgical process, which paired up with the refining processes, make up five major production routes (See Tab.1). All this routes are covered, aggregated according to their market share in 1994.
https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/00ebef53-ae97-400f-a602-7405e896cb76
Pyrometallurgy. The pyrometallurgical treatment of nickel concentrates includes three types of unit operation: roasting, smelting, and converting. In the roasting step sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide and part of the iron is oxidised. In smelting, the roaster product is melted with a siliceous flux which combines with the oxidised iron to produce two immiscible phases, a liquid silicate slag which can be discarded, and a solution of molten sulphides which contains the metal values. In the converting operation on the sulphide melt, more sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide, and the remaining iron is oxidised and fluxed for removal as silicate slag, leaving a high-grade nickel – copper sulphide matte. In several modern operations the roasting step has been eliminated, and the nickel sulphide concentrate is treated directly in the smelter.
Hydrometallurgy: Several hydrometallurgical processes are in commercial operation for the treatment of nickel – copper mattes to produce separate nickel and copper products. In addition, the hydrometal-lurgical process developed by Sherritt Gordon in the early 1950s for the direct treatment of nickel sulphide concentrates, as an alternative to smelting, is still commercially viable and competitive, despite very significant improvements in the economics and energy efficiency of nickel smelting technology. In a typical hydrometallurgical process, the concentrate or matte is first leached in a sulphate or chloride solution to dissolve nickel, cobalt, and some of the copper, while the sulphide is oxidised to insoluble elemental sulphur or soluble sulphate. Frequently, leaching is carried out in a two-stage countercurrent system so that the matte can be used to partially purify the solution, for example, by precipitating copper by cementation. In this way a nickel – copper matte can be treated in a two-stage leach process to produce a copper-free nickel sulphate or nickel chloride solution, and a leach residue enriched in copper.
Refining: In many applications, high-purity nickel is essential and Class I nickel products, which include electrolytic cathode, carbonyl powder, and hydrogen-reduced powder, are made by a variety of refining processes. The carbonyl refining process uses the property of nickel to form volatile nickel-carbonyl compounds from which elemental nickel subsides to form granules. Electrolytic nickel refineries treat cast raw nickel anodes in a electrolyte. Under current the anode dissolves and pure nickel deposits on the cathode. This electrorefining process is obsolete because of high energy demand and the necessity of building the crude nickel anode by reduction with coke. It is still practised in Russia. Most refineries recover electrolytic nickel by direct electrowinning from purified solutions produced by the leaching of nickel or nickel – copper mattes. Some companies recover refined nickel powder from purified ammoniacal solution by reduction with hydrogen.
Emissions: In all of the metallurgical steps, sulphur dioxide is emitted to air. Recovery of sulphur dioxide is only economic for high concentrated off-gas. Given that In the beneficiation step, considerable amounts of lime are added to the ore for pH-stabilisation, lime forms later flux in the metallurgical step, and decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carry over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to the air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Chlorine is used in some leaching stages and is produced during the subsequent electrolysis of chloride solution. The chlorine evolved is collected and re-used in the leach stage. The presence of chlorine in wastewater can lead to the formation of organic chlorine compounds (AOX) if solvents etc. are also present in a mixed wastewater. VOCs can be emitted from the solvent extraction stages. A variety of solvents are used an they contain various complexing agents to form complexes with the desired metal that are soluble in the organic layer. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Cu, Ni, Co, As and Cr. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages are the most important sources. The leaching stages are usually operated on a closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.
In the refining step, the combustion of sulphur leads to emissions of SO2. Nitrogen oxides are produced in significant amounts during acid digestion using nitric acid. Chlorine and HCl can be formed during a number of digestion, electrolytic and purification processes. Chlorine is used extensively in the Miller process and in the dissolution stages using hydrochloric acid and chlorine mixtrues respectively. Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Large quantities of effluents contain amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Regarding the metallurgical step, several co-products, residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue, are generated. Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds. In the refining step, quantities of solid residuals are also generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (ironhydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).

Technology:  Open-pit mining is applied and hydraulic excavators are used to extract the ore with different grades, which is transported to stockpiles awaiting homogenization through earth-moving equipment in order to attain the same concentration.
Conveyor belts (3.5 km) are utilized to transport the homogenized ore to the concentration unit.
Initially, the ore passes through a jaw crusher and moves to the ball mills, where the pyrochlore grains (1 mm average diameter) are reduced to diameters less than 0.104 mm. In the ball mills, recycled water is added in order to i) granulate the concentrate and ii) remove the gas from the sintering unit. The granulated ore undergoes i) magnetic separation, where magnetite is removed and is sold as a coproduct and ii) desliming in order to remove fractions smaller than 5μm by utilizing cyclones. Then the ore enters the flotation process - last stage of the beneficiation process – where the pyrochlore particles come into contact with flotation chemicals (hydrochloric & fluorosilic acid, triethylamene and lime), thereby removing the solid fractions and producing pyrochlore concentrate and barite as a coproduct which is also sold. The produced concentrate contains 55% Nb2O5 and 11% water and moves to the sintering unit, via tubes or is transported in bags while the separated and unused minerals enter the tailings dam.
In the sintering unit, the pyrochlore concentrate undergoes pelletizing, sintering, crushing and classification. These units not only accumulate the material but are also responsible for removing sulfur and water from the concentrate. Then the concentrate enters the dephosphorization unit, where phosphorus and lead are removed from the concentrate. The removal of sulphur and phosphorus have to be executed because of the local pyrochlore ore composition. Then the concentrate undergoes a carbothermic reduction by using charcoal and petroleum coke, producing a refined concentrate, 63% Nb2O5 and tailings with high lead content that are disposed in the tailings dam again.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from natural gas used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the countries providing the electricity from natural gas fired power plants. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",US,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in the United States. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",RU,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in the Russian Federation. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold mine operation and refining,lead,SE,kilogram,"This dataset was created by merging two separate multi-output datasets from ecoinvent database v2; ""mining, gold-silver-zinc-lead-copper deposit"" and ""refining, copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver, in smelter"".
This dataset describes the joint production of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Both mining and refining are included in this activity. The data on mining corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals. Data quality for emissions into air / water, as well as disposal of tailings, is low. Regarding the refining; gold and silver are supposed to be treated in the PGM plant in Rönnskär, whereas the other metals are supposed to undergo other treatments. A high share of the production is recycled metal, e.g. 74% for gold.
Geography:  Energy use and emissions during the mining are from Swedish mines. Material requirements during refinery for gold and silver are estimated with Australian data, cyanide consumption is estimated with US-Data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
HEAP LEACHING:
The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.
ORE PROCESSING:
Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.
Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks.
Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled.
Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.
Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",US,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in the United States. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Geography:  Data for Germany are used in this module for Europe. Some agents used like lime or  transport originate from data sets are valid only for Switzerland.
Technology:  The production process consists of three steps: Collection, Beneficiation and Refining. 
COLLECTION:
Spoiled automotive catalysts are bought by specialised enterprises from different origins. Part of it originates from scrap dealer recycling end-of-life cars. Further more during the cars operating phase, defective catalysts are exchanged in garages. The third sources is the production waste, i. e. defective catalysts which do not reach market. In most cases, there are fix agreements between the different supplier and the intermediary trade. Although the trade with PGM containing scrap is risky. Motor car manufacturer built up their own internal recycling systems with their contractor garages and gained access to exchanged catalysts.
Emissions: Emissions during collection are gases from transportation and dust from dismantling. Also in this step the combustion leads to emissions of SO2. No serious water emissions are reported. 
BENEFICIATION:
The catalysts are dismantled and then sold to refining companies. Refineries too have long-term contracts with the intermediary trade.
Emissions: Emissions during beneficiation are gases from transportation and dust from dismantling. Also in this step the combustion leads to emissions of SO2. No serious water emissions are reported. 
REFINING:
The scrap first is shredded and then pyrometallurgicaly processed: The scrap is smelted in an electric arc furnace, and the ceramic wafer is slagged. The PGMs are concentrated in the collector metal, usually copper. Low-content PGM scrap is often smelted together with other non-ferrous metal matte. This is cheap, but effects a high loss in PGM. The collector matte from the furnace then is treated hydrometallurgically by re-precipitation. In this step usually production scrap from other industries (glass, chemical laboratories) is joined. The overall PGM-yield is 98 % for platinum and 85 % for rhodium.
Emissions: Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Effluents from refining contain considerable amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Solid residues from pyrometallurgical step are usually re-used in copper facilities, final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes.

aluminium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"electricity production, hydro, aluminium industry","electricity, high voltage, aluminium industry","IAI Area, EU27 & EFTA",kilowatt hour,"This is a dataset used to create an aluminium industry specific electricity market for aluminium-producing countries within EU27 and EFTA (see Geography comment field for list of countries). The production volume represents the total amount of hydroelectricity used for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting) in the region. The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the hydroelectricity. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of hydroelectricity produced by the different technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage) is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of hydroelectricity coming from each country within the EU27+EFTA region (using country-specific aluminium production volumes, supplied by the European Aluminium Association and validated by the International Aluminium Institute, and, for all countries except GR, SK and SI, International Energy Agency data on electricity sources within each country) and (2) ecoinvent v3 country-specific split of hydroelectricity into different technologies. For countries SK, SI and GR, the share of hydroelectricity in the aluminium-specific grid mix were supplied by the IAI rather than determined by IEA data.
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",KZ,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Kazakhstan. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

The capsule is placed in a single furnace which is initially in a nearly horizontal position. A slight tilt in the furnace keeps the liquid and solid material at the small diameter end of the tube. The temperature of the furnace is raised to its final temperature of about 1110°C, at the conical tip end approximately 100°C lower. The temperature of the growth tube is held for about 16 to 20hrs, then the furnace is rotated about 90° to a vertical position. After the temperature is stabilized, the tube is lowered at a rate of about 1.2mm/hr until the solution has completely solidified.”

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,primary zinc production from concentrate,"copper concentrate, sulfide ore",RoW,kilogram,"The multi-output ""primary zinc production from concentrate"" process includes all steps required to produce special high grade zinc from zinc concentrate using the electrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical (less common) processes. Electrometallurgical zinc smelting includes roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, melting, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. Pyrometallurgical zinc smelting includes sintering, leaching, refining, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset. 
The below images present the system boundary in relation to the primary product, special high grade zinc.

Geography:  This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. 
The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.
Image: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/5fe963ea-10cc-44e7-a6a9-b8b4871bc917
Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. 
Electrometallurgical Smelting
The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).
Pyro-metallurgical Smelting
The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 & 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from nuclear used for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting) in the region. The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the electricity from nuclear power plants. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using pressure water reactors and boiling water reactors is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of  nuclear power coming from each country within EU27+EFTA; and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of nuclear power plants between pressure water reactors and boiling water reactors. The share of nuclear electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total nuclear electricity used in aluminium production in the EU27+EFTA region (using regional data supplied by the International Aluminium Institute [IAI] and the European Aluminium Association [EAA]). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: EAA personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). Exceptions to the general procedure are Greece, Slovakia and Slovania, for which the IAI provided country-specific aluminium-specific grid mixes.

aluminium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,aluminium chloride production,aluminium chloride,GLO,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of aluminium chloride from the reaction of aluminium melt and hot chlorine gas at high temperatures.
Aluminium chloride can be produced by the reaction of aluminium with chlorine gas and of aluminium or aluminium hydrozide with hydrochloric acid (Lee et al. 2011 and Helmboldt et al. 2007). This product is used to derive aluminium powder which is used in the fabrication of solar cells and electromagnetic fields (Lee et al. 2011). Aluminium chloride is also “[…] widely applied as acid catalyst, isomerization of hydrocarbon, catalyst of aldehyde synthesis, and catalyst of cation polymerization. In case of an anhydride, it is also used for cracking of oil, and catalyst of Friedel-Crafts reaction in an organic synthesis” (Lee et al. 2011, pp. 40).
The final product has usually a shading of yellow and gray caused by residues of the reactants. The pure product would instead have a white colour (Helmboldt 2007). Anhydrous aluminium chloride is a hydroscopic, solid that reacts with moisture and air. Aluminium chloride is soluble in chlorinated solvents, while it forms a complex when being dissolved in polar aprotic solvents (Kirk et al. 2004).
In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. The auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) and energy consumption exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.   For more information on the calculations refer to the sampling procedure.

Technology:  In the past years the most common method of production of aluminium chloride have been the reaction of aluminium and chlorine gas at high temperatures (Lee et al. 2011 and Helmboldt 2007). Notably, the alluminum could be sourced as a scrap, secondary ingot or prime ingot (Kirk et al. 2004). Chlorine gas is blown in baths of aluminium melt using cylindrical reactors with ceramic lining (Lee et al. 2011 and Helmboldt 2007). This reaction is exothermic with a heat delta of 1.41 MJ/mol, the reaction requires temperatures between 670 to 850 degrees Celsius.
Chemical reaction:
2Al + 3Cl2 -> 2AlCl3
The product sublimes through the melt pool and subsequently condenses into a vessel where it also solidifies on the condenser walls. The generated crystals of aluminium chloride are periodically removed, processed, and packed under a dry air or nitrogen atmosphere (Kirk et al. 2004). The hot gas that exits the melt pool is filtered to remove entrained liquids and solids, while the off-gases are purified before recycling.
In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, with a 95% recirculation for the remaining 5% of unreacted aluminium. Finally, the residual alluminium was assumed to be sent for landfill.

Time period:  In the past years the most common method of production of aluminium chloride have been the reaction of aluminium and chlorine gas at high temperatures (Lee et al. 2011 and Helmboldt 2007).
The time period spans from the earliest year from which at least one of the input values was obtained until 2020, but overall form the most realistic picture of the production. Besides, the activity is partly generated, in terms of material inputs and outputs, based on a generic stoichiometry-based model, using literature or estimated yields, which does not expect to change over time.
The source of information for the heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park. The values are a 5-year average of data from 2015 to 2019 published by the GENDORF Chemical Park, which is based in Germany and produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances in the years 2015-2019. The end time period is therefore set based on the years from Gendorf reference.

Technology:  Mining. Sulphidic copper ores are mined only 30% underground, the major part is mined in large open cut operations. The ore mined in 1900 in the U.S. had a high content of 3.4% and was mined entirely underground. Open pit mining permits the use of very large equipment. Resulting economies of scale enable the exploitation of lower grade disseminated (porphyry) ores – the ores now mainly mined. The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. Open cut mining generates large quantities of dust, which contains elevated contents of metals and sulphur. Rain percolates through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater. Overburden is deposed close to the mine. No overburden is refilled.
Beneficiation. After mining, the ore is first ground. In a next step it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metal-bearing particles from the unwanted minerals. After this first concentration step, flotation is carried out to remove the gangue from the sulphidic minerals. For neutralisation lime is added. In the flotation several organic chemicals ( such as  collectors (xanthate or aerofloat) and frothing reagent (eg. Methyl Isobutyl Carbinol)) are used as collector, frother, activator, depressor and flocculant. Sometimes cyanide is used as depressant for pyrite. Tailings usually are led to tailings heaps or ponds. As a result, copper concentrates containing around 30% Cu are produced. Molybdenite concentrate are further ground and purified. It leaves the process as co-product with a concentration of 90 – 95 % Molybdenum disulphide. The concentrated ore is fed to the metallurgy, which is assumed to be on-site. Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Flotation produces effluents containing several organic agents  used. Some of these chemicals evaporate and account for VOC emissions to air. Namely xanthates decompose hydrolytically to release carbon disulphide. Tailings effluent contains additional sulphuric acid from acid rock drainage.
Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. In the sulphidic tailings occurs acid rock drainage (ARD) over a long period of time.
Reserves and resources: Molybdenum and Copper are coexisting in porphyry deposits of the copper-molybdenum type, as molybdenite (MoS2) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). About half of the world-wide produced molybdenum is a co-product of the primary copper industry while for another substantial part copper is the co-product. Hence almost all of the molybdenum is produced in a process similar to the copper primary production. Molybdenum secondary production – mainly from spent petroleum catalysts – is not remarkable, and no secondary production is considered in this study. It's estimated that 30% of the molybdenum is re-used in the form of the molybdenum content steel alloys which are recycled to the foundries. Secondary production of copper from scrap plays an important role. The resources of primary copper are limited, a continuous depletion within 60 years is estimated.
Land-based resources of copper are estimated to be 1.6 billion tons , and resources in deep-sea nodules are estimated to be 700 million tons. A detailed overview over the global refinery production and a statistic on US use and production of copper is available in the online version of the USGS “Mineral Commodity Summary”. The world-wide mine estimated reserves by country are listed in Tab. 1.
Exploitable reserves of recoverable copper were estimated at about 100 million tons in 1935; new discoveries raised this to 212 million tons in 1960. Reserves grew again sharply to 340 million metric tons (MMT) in 1984, but since then they have declined slowly to 321 MMT in 1990 and 310 MMT in 1994. Estimates vary according to prices and assumptions. Total potential resources have increased somewhat over the same period, from 500 MMT to around 590 MMT. As a matter of interest, cumulative global production of copper between 1970 and 1996 was 216 MMT. With the actual mine production of around 13.5 MMT/a, the reserves would last 36 years and the reserve base 70 years.
Reserves of molybdenite in the market economy countries have been estimated in a survey evaluating identified ore bodies, i.e., those which have been explored as well as those which have been exploited. The results indicate the following amounts of recoverable molybdenum: United States, 4100 kt; Chile, 1770 kt; Canada, 928 kt; Mexico, 306 kt; Peru, 288 kt; other countries, 356 kt. Ore bodies producing primarily molybdenum contain 55 % of the reserves identified; only 29 % of these ore bodies were being exploited at the time of the survey (January 1985). Operations producing molybdenum as a byproduct contained the remaining 45 % of reserves and 67 % of them were producing molybdenite. The estimated total recoverable molybdenum from primary and byproduct reserves is listed in Tab. 2.

Priority was given to data contained in EAA (2008); Althaus (2009) was used only in cases where it was found to be more complete that EAA (2008).
Remelters use mainly reverbatory furnaces, and this dataset is based on this furnace technology only.
The dataset excludes, for lack of access to data, salt slag and dross recycling.  According to EAA, this data gap represents approximately 10-20% of potential impacts, as calculated using the CML 2001 method.
The following emissions to air are reported in EAA 2008 but excluded from this dataset: CO (0.095 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), Dust/particulates (0.041 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), NOx (0.329 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), SO2 (0.051 kg/tonne secondary aluminium), and VOC (0.050 kg/tonne secondary aluminium).  These are assumed to be combustion emissions or electricity production emissions, conclusion arrived at by comparing gate-to-gate emissions with the cradle-to-gate emissions also reported in EAA 2008.  Their inclusion wouldhave led to double-counting.
While this dataset represents the remelting of post-consumer scrap aluminium, the inputs and outputs reported by EAA (2008) actually refer to refining of new scrap.  In the ecoinvent database, both the remelting of post-consumer scrap and new scrap is represented by two distinct but mostly identical datasets to enable the appropriate modeling of aluminium mass flow through the economy.  The use of new scrap remelting to represent prepared old scrap remelting is thought to be more accurate than the use of refining as a proxy for this activity.  The extrapolation is accounted for in the uncertainty.

Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals. The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments. The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone. The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance. The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium. The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium.The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs). Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen. After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes. In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots. At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.
PLATINUM MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex. The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output. Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value. In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies. The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

Technology:  The ores from the different ore bodies are processed in concentrators where a PGM concentrate is produced with a tailing by product. The PGM base metal concentrate product from the different concentrators processing the different ores are blended during the smelting phase to balance the sulphur content in the final matte product. Smelter operators also carry out toll smelting from third part concentrators. The smelter product is send to the Base metal refinery where the PGMs are separated from the Base Metals. Precious metal refinery is carried out on PGM concentrate from the Base metal refinery to split the PGMs into individual metal products.

Geography:  Extrapolated from a global nickel production dataset.
Technology:  Extrapolated from a typical technology for smelting and refining of nickel ore.
MINING:
95% of sulphidic nickel ores are mined underground in depths between 200m and 1800m, the ore is transferred to the beneficiation. Widening of the tunnels is mainly done by blasting. The overburden – material, which does not contain PGM-bearing ore – is deposed off-site and is partially refilled into the tunnels.
Emissions: The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. The underground mining operations generate roughly 80 % of the dust emissions from open pit operations, since the major dust sources do not take place underground. Rain percolate through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater.
Waste: Overburden is deposed close to the mine. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
BENEFICIATION:
After mining, the ore is first ground. In a next step it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metallic particles from the PGM-bearing minerals. After this first concentration step, flotation is carried out to remove the gangue from the sulphidic minerals. For neutralisation lime is added. In the flotation several organic chemicals are used as collector, frother, activator, depressor and flocculant. Sometimes cyanide is used as depressant for pyrite. Tailings usually are led to tailing heaps or ponds. As a result, nickel concentrates containing 7 - 25% Ni are produced.
Emissions: Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Flotation produce effluents containing several organic agents used. Some of these chemicals evaporate and account for VOC emissions to air. Namely xanthates decompose hydrolytically to release carbon disulphide. Tailings effluent contains additional sulphuric acid from acid rock drainage.
Waste: Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. Acid rock drainage occurs over a long period of time.
METALLURGY AND REFINING:
There are many different process possibilities to win the metal. The chosen process depends on the composition of the ore, the local costs of energy carrier and the local legislation. Basically two different types can be distinguished: the hydrometallurgical and the pyrometallurgical process, which paired up with the refining processes, make up five major production routes (See Tab.1). All this routes are covered, aggregated according to their market share in 1994.
https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/00ebef53-ae97-400f-a602-7405e896cb76
Pyrometallurgy. The pyrometallurgical treatment of nickel concentrates includes three types of unit operation: roasting, smelting, and converting. In the roasting step sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide and part of the iron is oxidised. In smelting, the roaster product is melted with a siliceous flux which combines with the oxidised iron to produce two immiscible phases, a liquid silicate slag which can be discarded, and a solution of molten sulphides which contains the metal values. In the converting operation on the sulphide melt, more sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide, and the remaining iron is oxidised and fluxed for removal as silicate slag, leaving a high-grade nickel – copper sulphide matte. In several modern operations the roasting step has been eliminated, and the nickel sulphide concentrate is treated directly in the smelter.
Hydrometallurgy: Several hydrometallurgical processes are in commercial operation for the treatment of nickel – copper mattes to produce separate nickel and copper products. In addition, the hydrometal-lurgical process developed by Sherritt Gordon in the early 1950s for the direct treatment of nickel sulphide concentrates, as an alternative to smelting, is still commercially viable and competitive, despite very significant improvements in the economics and energy efficiency of nickel smelting technology. In a typical hydrometallurgical process, the concentrate or matte is first leached in a sulphate or chloride solution to dissolve nickel, cobalt, and some of the copper, while the sulphide is oxidised to insoluble elemental sulphur or soluble sulphate. Frequently, leaching is carried out in a two-stage countercurrent system so that the matte can be used to partially purify the solution, for example, by precipitating copper by cementation. In this way a nickel – copper matte can be treated in a two-stage leach process to produce a copper-free nickel sulphate or nickel chloride solution, and a leach residue enriched in copper.
Refining: In many applications, high-purity nickel is essential and Class I nickel products, which include electrolytic cathode, carbonyl powder, and hydrogen-reduced powder, are made by a variety of refining processes. The carbonyl refining process uses the property of nickel to form volatile nickel-carbonyl compounds from which elemental nickel subsides to form granules. Electrolytic nickel refineries treat cast raw nickel anodes in a electrolyte. Under current the anode dissolves and pure nickel deposits on the cathode. This electrorefining process is obsolete because of high energy demand and the necessity of building the crude nickel anode by reduction with coke. It is still practised in Russia. Most refineries recover electrolytic nickel by direct electrowinning from purified solutions produced by the leaching of nickel or nickel – copper mattes. Some companies recover refined nickel powder from purified ammoniacal solution by reduction with hydrogen.
Emissions: In all of the metallurgical steps, sulphur dioxide is emitted to air. Recovery of sulphur dioxide is only economic for high concentrated off-gas. Given that In the beneficiation step, considerable amounts of lime are added to the ore for pH-stabilisation, lime forms later flux in the metallurgical step, and decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carry over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to the air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Chlorine is used in some leaching stages and is produced during the subsequent electrolysis of chloride solution. The chlorine evolved is collected and re-used in the leach stage. The presence of chlorine in wastewater can lead to the formation of organic chlorine compounds (AOX) if solvents etc. are also present in a mixed wastewater. VOCs can be emitted from the solvent extraction stages. A variety of solvents are used an they contain various complexing agents to form complexes with the desired metal that are soluble in the organic layer. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Cu, Ni, Co, As and Cr. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages are the most important sources. The leaching stages are usually operated on a closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.
In the refining step, the combustion of sulphur leads to emissions of SO2. Nitrogen oxides are produced in significant amounts during acid digestion using nitric acid. Chlorine and HCl can be formed during a number of digestion, electrolytic and purification processes. Chlorine is used extensively in the Miller process and in the dissolution stages using hydrochloric acid and chlorine mixtrues respectively. Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Large quantities of effluents contain amounts of metals and organic substances.
Waste: Regarding the metallurgical step, several co-products, residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue, are generated. Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds. In the refining step, quantities of solid residuals are also generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (ironhydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).

This is the market for  'aluminium, primary, ingot', in the geography of IAI Area, EU27 & EFTA.
In 2012, the global consumption of primary aluminium is estimated at 50 million tonnes. 50% of this consumption is made in China. Moreover, China, represents about 50% of the primary aluminium production. Thus, China is a balance market and almost self sufficient. However, Europe has a huge deficit of primary aluminium.  About 45% - 50%  of the European consumption of primary is from imports. These  imports are coming mainly from 3 areas (Rest of Europe, Middle East and Africa).

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",KZ,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Kazakhstan. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,primary zinc production from concentrate,copper cake,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of high grade (SHG-Special High Grade) primary zinc by hydrometallurgical processes. Specific data were collected from the only producer in the Québec region, for the years 2011-2012.
Primary zinc is produced in the form of ingots and shot, respectively used as coating in steel work/die cast and for electroplating. About 25% of the produced zinc is in the form of an aluminium alloy.
The zinc concentrate, coming from all around the world (e.g. Canada (Québec and Ontario), Australia), is transported to the site by train or by ship and truck and mixed on site. The site is able to treate zinc concentrate contaminated with mercury and selenium but cannot recover silver and lead. Contrary to the GLO dataset, this dataset does not include waste contaning indium (""indium rich leaching residues, from zinc production"" by-product flow).
Geography:  This activity represents the production of primary zinc in the Québec region.
Technology:  Hydrometallurgical process
Sulphide concentrates are roasted first in fluidized bed roasters to produce zinc oxide (calcine) and sulphur dioxide. Roasting is an exothermic process and no additional fuel is used to sustain the reaction, the heat generated is recovered to produce steam. Calcine is then sent to the leaching step. Roaster gases are treated in hot electrostatics precipitators to remove dust. The remaining dust and volatile metals such as mercury and selenium are removed in the wet section of the acid plant through a cooling tour, a mist precipitator and a mercury tower (Boliden mercury removal processs). The sulphur dioxide is then converted to sulphuric acid in a conventional recovery system (converted and absorbing tower).
Leaching of the calcine is carried out in a number of successive stages using a gradually increasing strength of hot sulphuric acid. The initial stages dissolve the major part of the zinc oxide and the other stages dissolve the zinc ferrite (ZnO.Fe2O3) and convert iron into Jarosite (sodium Jarosite). Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) entering the electrolysis stage produce electrolyte (H2SO4) that is returned to leaching plant. Other metals are also dissolved during the process and are removed after leaching. Iron is the major impurity, which is precipitated in the form of Jarosite.
Overall waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several by-products, residues and wastes. Relatively large quantities of iron based solids, depending on the iron content, are generated by the leaching process (6.14E-1 kg Jarosite/kg zinc). Cement is added to the Jarosite to produce Jarofix (an inert waste). Solid residues also arise as the result of the liquid effluents treatment. The main waste stream is gypsum (CaSO4) and metal hydroxides that are produced at the wastewater neutralization plant. Mercury and selenium residues arise from the weak acid bleed treatment from the acid plant. Selenium can be recovered from these residues depending on the market demand for this metal.
Overall emissions: The emissions to air can either be stack emissions or fugitive emissions. Stack emissions are normally monitored continuously (SO2) or periodically (other emissions) and reported. The main emissions to air from zinc production are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matters including metals. Main emissions to water are metals and their compounds. The monitored metals are zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, copper and arsenic.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.', 'amount': 0.014, 'pedigree': {'reliability': 2, 'completeness': 1, 'temporal correlation': 1, 'geographical correlation': 1, 'further technological correlation': 1}, 'uncertainty type': 2, 'loc': -4.2687, 'scale': 0.20149441679609886, 'scale without pedigree': 0.2, 'name': 'fraction_PW_to_air'}, {'description': 'lifetime', 'id': '902d8a9c-c2b3-4b9e-855c-94bbe44f79db', 'unit': 'year', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",RU,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in the Russian Federation. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

The dataset also identifies the countries providing the electricity from oil fired power plants. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located.

Geography:  The dataset has been approximated from the respective dataset from CN. The data is assumed to be representative also of the global situation, since the Kroll process is the most common method for the production of titanium sponge.
Technology:  After the production of high-purity TiCl4, it enters the reduction and distillation process, where it is firstly reduced by adding magnesium and then vacuum-distilled, producing the so-called titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via the electrolysis process (modelled in a separate activity) and produces magnesium and chlorine. After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.
Time period:  Data are considered representative of current production practices. The data are assumed to be valid on average for 5 years after the publication of that article.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"smelting of copper concentrate, sulfide ore","copper, anode",CL,kilogram,"This dataset represents the smelting of copper concentrates to produce copper anodes in Chile.
Background: Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner & Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.

The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset.

Geography:  This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. 
The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.

Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. 
Electrometallurgical Smelting
The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).
Pyro-metallurgical Smelting
The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 & 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then.

Technology:  OPERATIONS
Over the next century of underground gold mining, several residue dumps arose from mining one of the largest orebodies ever mined. Significantly, these waste dumps contained minute gold particles that, with scale and technology, have become financially feasible to mine. The waste dumps are classified into two specific types: sand and slime dumps. Sand dumps are the by-product of the “stamp milling” process, which left coarser sand residue. Most of these sand dumps have been reclaimed. Slime dumps are the by-product of the tube and ball mill recovery process, comprising much finer material and generally containing lower gold grades. 
Tailings retreatment in South Africa began in the 1970s and the process involves the extraction of minute particles of gold from past mining 'waste', and operations are performed by three major companies, namely AngloGoldAshanti Mine Waste Solution (AGA-MWS), at Harmony’s sites and at DRDGold Ergo Operations; they mostly lay in the Witwatersrand Basin Area.
AGAMWS surface operations encompasses those facilities at the Vaal River and West Wits operations which process and extract gold from: marginal ore dumps on surface and tailings storage facilities on surface. Surface Operations also includes Mine Waste Solutions (MWS), which operates independently, processing slurry material reclaimed hydraulically from the various tailings storage facilities. Uranium is produced as a by-product, as is backfill for use as mining support in underground mined out areas. 
Harmony – It comprises several surface sources in South Africa - Phoenix, a tailings retreatment operation situated in Virginia in the Free State Province, makes use of the Saaiplaas plant to retreat tailings. 
DRDGOLD – ErgoOperations - Ergo Gold Mining Proprietary Limited (Ergo), one of the world’s largest gold surface tailings retreatment facilities, owns the rights to treat around 100 sand dumps and slimes dams on the Witwatersrand. Some of these are currently being treated.
Surface recovery: The retreatment business is high-volume and low-risk. Vast quantities of material are processed in order to recover gold from old mine dumps at a recovery rate that varies depending on the material being treated. Sand and Slime Sand dumps are the result of the less efficient ‘stamp-milling’ process employed in the early gold mining years. They consist of coarse-grained particles which generally contain higher quantities of gold. Sand dumps are reclaimed mechanically using front end loaders that load sand onto conveyor belts. The sand is fed onto a screen where water is added to wash the sand into a sump, from where it is pumped to the plant. Most sand dumps have already been retreated using more efficient milling methods. Slimes dams are also the result of older treatment methods, although they are more recent than sand dumps, and contain lower grades of gold. However, this material has become economically more viable to process owing to improved treatment methods and a higher gold price. The material from the slimes dams is broken down using monitor guns that spray jets of high pressure water at the target area. The resulting slurry is then pumped to a treatment plant for processing.
Flotation/fine-grind and CIL: The slurry material from the reclamation sites feeds into the plant via a complex pipe network. Here it passes over linear screens to remove organic material and debris. The slurry then enters a flotation section consisting of banks of flotation cells. After the material is conditioned with reagents (collectors and frothers) it enters the cells where it is separated into two streams. One stream, the flotation concentrate, contains the sulphides which are enriched with gold while the second stream, the flotation tails, is made up of lower-grade siliceous material. This stream is treated by the conventional CIL process, which is the treatment process that has been used for the past 30 years with an extraction efficiency of 39% to 40%.
The concentrate stream is subjected to the new fine-grind process which research and development has demonstrated is more efficient in recovering the gold. Fine-grind involves milling the slurry material with tiny beads. At this stage the milled product, 80% of which is smaller than 24 microns, has been liberated from the sulphides, making recovery of the previously encapsulated gold easier as it comes into contact with cyanide during the process that follows. Research shows the extraction efficiency of this process to be 75% to 76%.
The dissolved gold is adsorbed onto activated carbon, and the ‘loaded carbon’ in each circuit enters the carbon treatment section where the gold is eluted from the carbon. The carbon then returns to the CIL circuit via a regeneration kiln. Once the gold has been eluted, it undergoes a process called electro-winning where the gold is precipitated, calcined and smelted in the existing smelthouse. The two eluate streams are kept separate to allow for accurate accounting of the gold produced by the respective high- and low-grade circuits. The leach residues are combined before being pumped to the BTF.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",CA,kilogram,"'This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Canada. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.
According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.
Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.
Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.
0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.

This proxy has been chosen because of the higher composition of copper (21%) and the nature of the process, namely hydrometallurgy. The original flows related to the mining infrastructure and mining processes have been deleted. They are only relevant for the primary winning of copper from ore. The extraction of Aluminium and Manganese has been reflected with the addition of byproducts in the process. The composition of the non-Fe-Co-metals is 21% Copper, 14.4% Aluminium and 12.4% Manganese. This composition is calculated from the Li-Ion battery production, including cathode and anode components. The rest of flows have not been adapted. No emissions are considered in this activity due to the lack of data. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. 
Geography:  average world-wide process
Technology:  The technique SX-EW is used mainly for oxide ores and supergene sulphide ores (i.e. ores not containing iron). It is assumed to be used for the treatment of the non-Fe-Co-metals fraction. The process includes a leaching stage followed by cementation or electro-winning.  A general description of the process steps is given below.
In the dump leaching step, copper is recovered from large quantities (millions of tonnes) of strip oxide ores with a very low grade. Dilute sulphuric acid is trickled through the material. Once the process starts it continues naturally if water and air are circulated through the heap. The time required is typically measured in years. Sulphur dioxide is emitted during such operations. Soluble copper is then recovered from drainage tunnels and ponds. Copper recovery rates vary from 30% to 70%. Cconsiderable amounts of sulphuric acid and leaching agents emit into water and air. No figures are currently available on the dimension of such emissions. After the solvent-solvent extraction, considerable amounts of leaching residues remain, which consist of undissolved minerals and the remainders of leaching chemicals.
In the solution cleaning step occur precipitation of impurities and filtration or selective enrichment of copper by solvent extraction or ion exchange. The solvent extraction process comprises two steps: selective extraction of copper from an aqueous leach solution into an organic phase (extraction circuit) and the re-extraction or stripping of the copper into dilute sulphuric acid to give a solution suitable for electro winning (stripping circuit).
In the separation step occurs precipitation of copper metal or copper compounds such as Cu2O, CuS, CuCl, CuI, CuCN, or CuSO4 • 5 H2O (crystallisation)
Waste: Like in the pyrometallurgical step, considerable quantities of solid residuals are generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (iron hydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).

PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

Technology:  There are two ways for mining zircon sand: dry & wet mining with the choice of mining depending on the structure of the geological deposit. During wet mining, floating dredges and a floating concentrator are utilized in an enclosed pond, where the concentrator moves behind the dredges. Wet mining is the preferred technique for large continuous deposits with amounts of clay. 
For all other types of HMS deposits (hard-ground deposits, discontinuous deposits and small tonnage high-grade deposits), dry mining is the most preferred mining process. Dry mining utilizes earth-moving machinery (loaders, excavators, scrapes) for the purposes of sand excavation and transportation to the concentrator. The mining unit plants used in dry mining are mobile in order to minimize the transport distance of the sand. 
After the transportation of the HMS to the respective concentrator, wet gravity separations techniques (spirals) are usually applied for the production of the heavy mineral concentrate (HMC), although some hard-rock sites use bulk froth flotation to extract the heavy minerals from the sand. The produced slurry from dry and wet mining is then fed to the concentrator, where the HMC (90-96% heavy minerals) is produced along with the tailings that are backfilled in the mined areas. The HMC is transported to a mineral separation plant (MSP), where the HMC is subjected to scrubbing, drying and is separated by magnetic, electrostatic and gravity separation, producing zircon sand, ilmenite and rutile, with the last two considered as byproducts.

This is in the North-Eastern region of the province KwaZulu-Natal.
The mineral sands are harvested via a system of ponds and floating dredges and the concentration is done on a floating gravity separation plant. These two stages of the process take place in the same location. The concentrator produces two streams: a magnetic and non-magnetic stream. The magnetic stream consists of ilmenite while the non-magnetic stream consists of zircon and rutile. 
This concentrate is transported to the second location where the Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) and the smelter are situated. At the MSP the various minerals are separated to produce zircon, rutile and ilmenite.
The ilmenite is smelted to produce titania slag (85% TiO2). High quality (low manganese content) pig iron is produced as a by-product in this stage. The ilmenite first undergoes an oxidizing roast followed by magnetic separation where the Cr2O3 fraction of the ilmenite is removed. The ilmenite is then partially reduced to 85% TiO2 slag in a six-in-line A.C. electric arc furnace

Reference: ""The Environmental Performance of Refined Cobalt - Life Cycle Inventory and Life Cycle Assessment of Refined Cobalt - Summary Report"", CDI & ERM, Novermber 2016. PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

The data is assumed to be representative also of the Australian situation, since Australia is one of the major producers of zircon sand. 
Technology:  There are two ways for mining zircon sand: dry & wet mining with the choice of mining depending on the structure of the geological deposit. During wet mining, floating dredges and a floating concentrator are utilized in an enclosed pond, where the concentrator moves behind the dredges. Wet mining is the preferred technique for large continuous deposits with amounts of clay. 
For all other types of HMS deposits (hard-ground deposits, discontinuous deposits and small tonnage high-grade deposits), dry mining is the most preferred mining process. Dry mining utilizes earth-moving machinery (loaders, excavators, scrapes) for the purposes of sand excavation and transportation to the concentrator. The mining unit plants used in dry mining are mobile in order to minimize the transport distance of the sand. 
After the transportation of the HMS to the respective concentrator, wet gravity separations techniques (spirals) are usually applied for the production of the heavy mineral concentrate (HMC), although some hard-rock sites use bulk froth flotation to extract the heavy minerals from the sand. The produced slurry from dry and wet mining is then fed to the concentrator, where the HMC (90-96% heavy minerals) is produced along with the tailings that are backfilled in the mined areas. The HMC is transported to a mineral separation plant (MSP), where the HMC is subjected to scrubbing, drying and is separated by magnetic, electrostatic and gravity separation, producing zircon sand, ilmenite and rutile, with the last two considered as byproducts.

Geography:  This dataset is a copy of the South African dataset for the production of refined gold and it is also used as the best available representation of the GLO situation of the sector as well. Figure below provide the overview top gold producer globally (source: www.focus-economics.org).
Rand Refinery (Pty) Limited is the largest integrated single-site precious metals refining and smelting complex in the world. Rand Refinery is the refining hub for Africa and increasingly beyond. It was established in 1920 to refine gold within South Africa which until that time had been refined in London. Since its inception it has refined nearly 50,000 tonnes of gold.[1] This represents some 30% of all the gold mined in the world since antiquity. 
Image: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/2373e982-a28b-463e-b140-e24663691d9f
Technology:  REFINING: The refinery, which provides a same day refining service, employs the widely used Miller Chlorination Process to upgrade the gold bullion it receives from mines to at least 99.50% fine gold, the minimum standard required for gold sold on the world bullion markets. It also employs the world’s leading silver refining technology. To further refine gold and silver to 99.99% the cost-effective once-through Wohlwill electrolytic refining process is used.
MILLER CHLORINATION PROCESS: This is a pyrometallurgical process whereby gold dore is heated in furnace crucibles. The process is able to separate gold from impurities by using chlorine gas which is added to the crucibles once the gold is molten. Chlorine gas does not react with gold but will combine with silver and base metals to form chlorides. Once the chlorides have formed they float to the surface as slag or escape as volatile gases. The surface melt and the fumes containing the impurities are collected and further refined to extract the gold and silver. 
This process can take up to 90 minutes produces gold which is at least 99.5% pure with silver being the main remaining component. This gold can be cast into bars as 99.5% gold purity meets the minimum London Good Delivery. However some customers such as jewellers and other industrial end users require gold that is almost 100% pure, so further refining is necessary. In this case, gold using the Miller process is cast into anodes which are then sent to an electrolytic plant. The final product is 99.99% pure gold sponge that can then be melted to produce various end products suited to the needs of the customer.
WOHLWILL PROCESS - The electrolytic method of gold refining was first developed by Dr. Emil Wohlwill of Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg in 1874. Dr. Wohlwill’s process is based on the solubility of gold but the insolubility of silver in an electrolyte solution of gold chloride (AuCl3) in hydrochloric acid.

Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

Of the four only Anglo-American Platinum, Lonmin Platinum and Impala Platinum operate refineries. Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) is recovered through underground and open pit mining. The processing of the ore consists of concentration, smelting and refining.
PGM mining in South Africa is located in the Bushveld Complex, which includes three distinct mineral-bearing reefs: The Merensky Reef, The UG2 Reef and Platreef.
[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]
Geography:  THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX: The Bushveld Complex, formed some 2 billion years ago, is found in the northern part of South Africa, and is the world’s largest layered intrusion. This igneous body hosts more than half the work’s platinum group metals, and other associated minerals such as chromium, vanadium and refractory minerals.
The intrusion is divided into four limbs – the northern, southern, eastern and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex is made up of the Rustenburg Layered Suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics. It is underlain by rocks from the Transvaal Supergroup and overlain by Karoo sediments.
The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains mainly mafic rocks and is divided into a number of different zones. The marginal zone is found around the edge of the intrusion, while from the base of the complex up is the Lower Zone, the Critical Zone, the Main Zone and lastly the Upper Zone.
The chromitite seams in the Critical Zone are divided into the lower, the middle and the upper groups (UG), with the LG6, UG1 and UG2 being of greatest economic importance.
The magnetite in the Upper Zone is rich in vanadium.
The Merensky Reef is found between the Critical and the Main Zone, and is rich in Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) – i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium.The complex has its geographic centre located north of Pretoria and it covers over 66.000 km2.
PLATINUM IN HISTORY: The first known occurrence of platinum in an application dates back to 700BC in Egypt, where the metal was used in the Casket of Thebes (a little box decorated with hieroglyphics in gold, silver and an alloy of PGMs).
Much later, in the 1500s in South America, the Spanish Conquistadors found many occurrences of what they termed platina, while they were panning for gold. In Europe, scientists of the day had a difficult time of trying to categorise and find application for the metal, mainly because of its durability and other extraordinary properties. A breakthrough came in the 18th century when a Swedish researcher added arsenic to the metal, but it was only in 1782 that platinum was successfully melted by adding oxygen.
After a further 25 years it became possible to produce platinum commercially using this method, and the metal was used mainly for decorative purposes. With the scientific and technological progress in the enlightenment era, there were breakthroughs in the refining of platinum, followed by the discovery of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic properties of platinum became apparent for the first time, and the first fuel cell was devised in 1842 using platinum electrodes.
In England the collaborative work of Percival Norton Johnson and his apprentice George Matthey gave rise to the eponymous partnership Johnson and Matthey. Their work at the time culminated in perfecting the techniques of separation and refining of PGMs and casting the metal in homogeneous ingots.
At that stage supplies were difficult to source, and came primarily from Colombia, the Urals in Russia and from later discoveries in Canada, which became the world’s largest supplier until the mid 20th century.
PLATINUM MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In South Africa the discovery of the first platinum nuggets dates back to 1924. The geologist Hans Merensky’s follow-up work resulted in the discovery of two deposits, each around 100 kilometres in length, which became known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. This discovery started with test work in the area around Mashishing (formerly known as Lydenburg). Based on successive encouraging findings, Merensky approached a circle of friends to raise funds to investigate any payable platinum deposits. He used the farm Maandagshoek as a base and later secured 23 claims, and worked quickly to locate other platinum occurrences in the area. Merensky’s work resulted in the naming of the Merensky reef. In 1925 follow-up work resulted in the identification of the eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex.
The mines on this geological structure have for many years produced more than 75% of the world’s output.
Since World War 2 platinum mine production grew continuously in response to new applications being developed for the metals. A significant new use of platinum was in the petroleum industry, where platinum catalysts were introduced to increase the octane rating of petroleum and to manufacture important primary feedstocks for the growing plastics industry. This was followed in the 1960s by growing demand for platinum jewellery – given its purity, colour, prestige and value.
In the latter half of the 20th century, the platinum sector in South Africa was dominated by Gencor, JCI and Lonrho. Corporate actions eventually saw the mines in these groups housed under Implats, Amplats and Lonmin respectively, the majors in the sector, and responsible for producing up to 80% of the world’s PGM supplies.
The advent of black economic empowerment, and the use-it-or-lose-it approach to minerals rights (envisaged in the MPRDA) led to a shift in the sector, and the growth and rise of smaller platinum companies, including intense interest from foreign investors and operators alike. This legislation coincided with an upswing in PGM demand and prices from 2002 through to 2008, before a global economic depression heralded the end of the glory days in the platinum sector and shut many smaller operators down.

Technology:  The ores from the different ore bodies are processed in concentrators where a PGM concentrate is produced with a tailing by product. The PGM base metal concentrate product from the different concentrators processing the different ores are blended during the smelting phase to balance the sulphur content in the final matte product. Smelter operators also carry out toll smelting from third part concentrators. The smelter product is send to the Base metal refinery where the PGMs are separated from the Base Metals. Precious metal refinery is carried out on PGM concentrate from the Base metal refinery to split the PGMs into individual metal products.

The actual countries covered by this region are Russia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the coal-based electricity in the region. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from each country within the region 'Europe outside EU27 and EFTA'; and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite. The share of coal electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total coal electricity used in aluminium production in the region (based on International Aluminium Institute [IAI] data for Europe as a whole and European Aluminium Agency data for EU27 and EFTA countries). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: IAI personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). For ME, coal-based electricity is assumed to be 78% hard coal, 22% lignite (based on 'rest of world' data, i.e. on data representing all regions not covered in ecoinvent v3.2).

PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold production,gold,CA,kilogram,"This dataset describes the production of 1 kg of gold. Data was taken from the environmental report of Placer Dome Inc. for the Campbell, Musselwhite and Porcupine Mines, which produce only gold.  Campbell and Musselwhite are underground mines, whereas Porcupine has underground and open pit mines. For the inventory, most by product and exchange amounts were calculated by adding the corresponding inputs or outputs of each mine, and then scaling them to the reference flow of 1 kg of gold. Since the mines have been sold in 2006 to Kinross Gold Corporation and Goldcorp Inc., no actual data is available. Both enterprises do not publish their environmental data. Therefore, data from 2002 is used to model the gold production in Canada.
[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]
Beneficiation, concentration and refinement of gold.
total requirements and emissions of the Campbell, Musselwhite and Porcupine Mines in 2002 as well as the total for Canada.
Geography:  Material requirements for gold concentration are estimated with Australian data, air emission are estimated with Swedish data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
UNDERGROUND MINING:
Some ore bodies are more economically mined underground. In this case, a tunnel called an adit or a shaft is dug into the earth. Sort tunnels leading from the adit or shaft, called stopes, are dug to access the ore. The surface containing the ore, called a face, is drilled and loaded with explosives. Following blasting, the broken ore is loaded onto electric trucks and taken to the surface. Once mining is completed in a particular stope, it is backfilled with a cement compound. 
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
BENEFICIATION:
In the Porcupine Mines, gold is recovered using a combination of gravity concentration, milling and cyanidation techniques. The milling process consists of primary crushing, secondary crushing, rod/ball mill grinding, gravity concentration, cyanide leaching, carbon-in-pulp gold recovery, stripping, electrowinning and refining. 
In the Campbell Mine, the ore from the mine, after crushing and grinding, is processed by gravity separation, flotation, pressure oxidation, cyanidation and carbon-in-pulp process followed by electro-winning and gold refining to doré on site.
The Musselwhite Mine uses gravity separation, carbon in pulp, electro¬winning and gold refining to doré on site.
REFINING:
Wohlwill electrolysis. It is assumed that the gold doré-bars from both mines undergo the treatment of Wohlwill electrolysis. This process uses an electrolyte containing 2.5 mol/l of HCl and 2 mol/l of HAuCl4 acid. Electrolysis is carried out with agitation at 65 – 75 °C. The raw gold is intro-duced as cast anode plates. The cathodes, on which the pure gold is deposited, were for many years made of fine gold of 0.25 mm thickness. These have now largely been replaced by sheet titanium or tantalum cathodes, from which the thick layer of fine gold can be peeled off. In a typical electrolysis cell, gold anodes weighing 12 kg and having dimensions 280×230×12 mm (0.138 m2 surface) are used. Opposite to them are conductively connected cathode plates, arranged by two or three on a support rail. One cell normally contains five or six cathode units and four or five anodes. The maximum cell voltage [V] is 1.5 V and the maximum anodic current density [A] 1500 A/m2. The South African Rand refinery gives a specific gold production rate of 0.2 kg per hour Wohlwill electrolysis. Assuming a current efficiency of 95% the energy consumption is [V] x [A] / 0.2 [kg/h] = 1.63 kWh per kg gold refined. No emissions are assumed because of the purity and the high value of the material processed. The resulting sludge contains the PGM present in the electric scrap and is sold for further processing.
WATER EMISSIONS:
Effluents are discharged into the ocean.

Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

The dataset describes the production of zinc concentrate and additional co-products, primarily lead concentrate. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset. Zinc concentrate is most often used as an input to zinc smelting, either electrometallurgical smelting or the less common pyrometallurgical smelting.

Technology:  The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as mining and concentration methods for zinc are consistent in all regions.
Mining
The mining of zinc ore includes underground and open cast mining processes. Within the global zinc industry, about 80% of zinc ore comes from underground mines and 20% from open pit or combination mines.
- Underground Mining: Access is via vertical shafts or inclined roadways. There are usually two access routes (one for mining personnel and materials, and one for the ore) for safety and for ease of ventilation (fresh air comes in one and is then exhausted out of the other). These are permanent structures and therefore require strong roof supports (often including ""bolts"" into the rock to tie the layers together for strength). Once at the correct depth has been reached, horizontal tunnels are driven to reach the ore deposit. These are often temporary, so the support requirements are less substantial. Transport for personnel and materials can be by train, truck or conveyor belts. The largest share of the consumed fuels is diesel followed by electricity. Other major inputs include explosives and water.
- Open Pit Mining: Hard-rock surface mining usually includes drilling, blasting, or a combination of both processes, and then lifting of the broken ore either into trucks or onto conveyors for transportation to the processing plant. This lifting is usually by excavator (electric or hydraulic; with shovel or backhoe configuration) or front-end loader.
Benefication (Comminution and Flotation)
Zinc ore is milled and mixed with water to recover a fine concentrate by gravity and elutriation techniques, creating a slurry. The separation process of the metal from the slurry is realized through the addition of various floatation chemicals.
Time period:  All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012.

titanium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,heavy mineral sand quarry operation,"rutile, 95% titanium dioxide",AU,kilogram,"Geography:  This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography of GLO. The data is assumed to be representative also of the Australian situation, since Australia is one of the major producers of zircon sand. 
Technology:  There are two ways for mining zircon sand: dry & wet mining with the choice of mining depending on the structure of the geological deposit. During wet mining, floating dredges and a floating concentrator are utilized in an enclosed pond, where the concentrator moves behind the dredges. Wet mining is the preferred technique for large continuous deposits with amounts of clay. 
For all other types of HMS deposits (hard-ground deposits, discontinuous deposits and small tonnage high-grade deposits), dry mining is the most preferred mining process. Dry mining utilizes earth-moving machinery (loaders, excavators, scrapes) for the purposes of sand excavation and transportation to the concentrator. The mining unit plants used in dry mining are mobile in order to minimize the transport distance of the sand. 
After the transportation of the HMS to the respective concentrator, wet gravity separations techniques (spirals) are usually applied for the production of the heavy mineral concentrate (HMC), although some hard-rock sites use bulk froth flotation to extract the heavy minerals from the sand. The produced slurry from dry and wet mining is then fed to the concentrator, where the HMC (90-96% heavy minerals) is produced along with the tailings that are backfilled in the mined areas. The HMC is transported to a mineral separation plant (MSP), where the HMC is subjected to scrubbing, drying and is separated by magnetic, electrostatic and gravity separation, producing zircon sand, ilmenite and rutile, with the last two considered as byproducts.

aluminium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"electricity production, hydro, aluminium industry","electricity, high voltage, aluminium industry",UN-OCEANIA,kilowatt hour,"This is a dataset used to create an aluminium industry specific electricity market for 'aluminium production Area 7' (Oceania). The production volume represents the total amount of hydroelectricity used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the hydroelectricity in the region. 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of hydroelectricity produced by the different technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage) is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of hydroelectricity coming from each country within Area 7 (using country-specific aluminium production volumes and International Energy Agency data on electricity sources within each country) and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of hydroelectricity for AU. For NZ, hydroelectricity is assumed to be produced in non-alpine reservoir hydroelectric plants.
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore","copper concentrate, sulfide ore",RoW,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores globally.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

PM2.5-10 and PM10 emissions to air arise from mine ventillation systems.
Geography:  The data has been collected from a globally representative sample of companies in the cobalt industry.
Technology:  Cobalt, as a co-product of nickel and copper production, is obtained using a wide range of technologies. The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companies’ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.

Separate energy data was provided by IAI for production of hydrate and calcination processes. The Al(OH)3 extraction process involves adding milled bauxite to a hot caustic soda (NaOH) solution, dissolving the aluminium-bearing minerals (gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore) present to form a sodium aluminate supersaturated solution or “pregnant liquor”. Flocculants are added to aid settling and the solution is progressively cooled causing aluminium hydroxide crystals to precipitate.

The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used in Area 1 (Africa) for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). 
Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. 
It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.
The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from each country within Area 1; and  (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite. The share of coal electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total coal electricity used in aluminium production in Area 1 (Africa) region as reported by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: IAI personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). 
For countries whose electricity production is not modelled in ecoinvent (all but South Africa [ZA] for Area 1), coal-based electricity is assumed to be 78% hard coal, 22% lignite (based on 'rest of world' data, i.e. on data representing all regions not covered in ecoinvent v3.2).
Calculations are detailed in the report 'Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3', available on the ecoinvent website.

Geography:  Material requirements are estimated with Australian data
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
BENEFICIATION:
The processing plant consists of primary crushing, a pre-crushing circuit, (semi autogenous ball mill crushing) grinding, leaching, filtering and washing, Merrill-Crowe plant and doré refinery. The Merrill-Crowe metal recovery circuit is better than a carbon-in-pulp system for the high-grade silver material.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"processing of anode slime from electrorefining of copper, anode",selenium,GLO,kilogram,"For the processing of anode slimes from primary copper electrorefining globally.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.
Modelling approach: Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere were taken from the treatment activity, “treatment of precious metal from electronics scrap, in anode slime, precious metal extraction”, which was used here as a proxy for the treatment of anode slime from primary copper production via pyrometallurgy. The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Further information is provided in the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020). Electrical energy demand was based on Chatterjee et al. (1996).

Geography:  Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere based on data from a Swedish anode slime processing plant that is singular in the region and ranges worldwide among the big producer. It may be taken as approximation for the global situation. Amounts of by-products based on the typical global situation.
Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Anode slime treatment by pressure leaching and top blown rotary converter. Production of Silver by Möbius Electrolysis, Gold by Wohlwill electrolysis, copper telluride cement and crude selenium to further processing.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but the amounts of by-products have been adjusted to represent the current situation.
