copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation",CA,kilogram,"'This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Canada. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at copper mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore",molybdenite,CA,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in Canada.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold-silver mine operation with refinery,gold,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset describes the production of gold and silver in Quebec (Canada) in 2012. This includes the operations at the mining site located in Quebec, i.e. mining, benefication and a first refining, which leads to the production of doré bars, containing gold, silver and impurities. 
Specific data were collected from 3 mines that produced doré bars in Quebec. These mines represent about 98% of Quebec gold production and about 95% of Quebec silver production from combined gold-silver mines. Share is estimated as the production statistics for 2012-2013 are not published yet and considers gold-silver mines only (not gold and silver coming from other mines). One mine is an open-pit mine and the two others are underground. A weighted average of 839 tonnes of ore is extracted per kg of gold produce. The recovery rate of gold is known for two of the mines (89% and 91%) and the recovery rate of silver known for only one mine (76%). 
Note that the mine infrastructure are extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset, where the modelled mines are open pit. This is not representative of the Quebec situation where two of the three modelled mine are underground. Thus a mine infrastrucuture, gold and silver, Québec will eventually be created in order to reflect the Québec specificity. 
In order to create a dataset with gold and silver as outputs (to comply with the boundaries of the GLO dataset), a very simplified modeling of the refining of the doré bars to produce gold and silver has been added to this dataset although it is done in Ontario (Canada) : electricity use is extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, PE and PG datasets and infrastructure extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset. 
It is assume that the refining efficency is 100% (i.e. no loss of gold).
Geography:  Inputs and outputs for mining, benefication and a first refining relate to Quebec production. Inputs for doré bar refining, which is done in Ontario, are extrapolated from dataset gold-silver mine operation with refinery (PG, CL, SE).
Technology:  One of the modelled mine is an open-pit mine and the two others are underground.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation",CA,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Canada. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at gold mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

This dataset is a disagreggation of the existing dataset ''nickel mine operation, sulfidic ore'', which contains smelting and refining on top of the mine operation. The disagreggation was done  because primary data was available for nickel mine operation but not for subsequent stages of smelting and refining. Thus, the production volume of this dataset is already included in the global dataset ''nickel mine operation, sulfidic ore, GLO''. Until data on smelting and refining become available, this dataset cannot be used as part of a life cycle assessment.
The concentrate produced is composed of 16% Ni; 4% Cu; 0.24% Co; 0.61 g/t Au; 10.84 g/t Ag; 2.8 g/t Pt; 9.68 g/t Pd; 0.95 g/t Rh.
The sulfidic nickel ore is extracted in an underground mine, where 7.21 kg of ore are extracted per kg of concentrate produced. The recovery rate (metal in ore/metal in the concentrate) is 90% for Ni and 82% for Cu.

aluminium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"aluminium production, primary, ingot","aluminium, primary, ingot",CA,kilogram,"The dataset represents the production of 1kg of primary aluminium ingot. Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,primary zinc production from concentrate,copper cake,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of high grade (SHG-Special High Grade) primary zinc by hydrometallurgical processes. Specific data were collected from the only producer in the Québec region, for the years 2011-2012.
Primary zinc is produced in the form of ingots and shot, respectively used as coating in steel work/die cast and for electroplating. About 25% of the produced zinc is in the form of an aluminium alloy.
The zinc concentrate, coming from all around the world (e.g. Canada (Québec and Ontario), Australia), is transported to the site by train or by ship and truck and mixed on site. The site is able to treate zinc concentrate contaminated with mercury and selenium but cannot recover silver and lead. Contrary to the GLO dataset, this dataset does not include waste contaning indium (""indium rich leaching residues, from zinc production"" by-product flow).
Geography:  This activity represents the production of primary zinc in the Québec region.
Technology:  Hydrometallurgical process
Sulphide concentrates are roasted first in fluidized bed roasters to produce zinc oxide (calcine) and sulphur dioxide. Roasting is an exothermic process and no additional fuel is used to sustain the reaction, the heat generated is recovered to produce steam. Calcine is then sent to the leaching step. Roaster gases are treated in hot electrostatics precipitators to remove dust. The remaining dust and volatile metals such as mercury and selenium are removed in the wet section of the acid plant through a cooling tour, a mist precipitator and a mercury tower (Boliden mercury removal processs). The sulphur dioxide is then converted to sulphuric acid in a conventional recovery system (converted and absorbing tower).
Leaching of the calcine is carried out in a number of successive stages using a gradually increasing strength of hot sulphuric acid. The initial stages dissolve the major part of the zinc oxide and the other stages dissolve the zinc ferrite (ZnO.Fe2O3) and convert iron into Jarosite (sodium Jarosite). Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) entering the electrolysis stage produce electrolyte (H2SO4) that is returned to leaching plant. Other metals are also dissolved during the process and are removed after leaching. Iron is the major impurity, which is precipitated in the form of Jarosite.
Overall waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several by-products, residues and wastes. Relatively large quantities of iron based solids, depending on the iron content, are generated by the leaching process (6.14E-1 kg Jarosite/kg zinc). Cement is added to the Jarosite to produce Jarofix (an inert waste). Solid residues also arise as the result of the liquid effluents treatment. The main waste stream is gypsum (CaSO4) and metal hydroxides that are produced at the wastewater neutralization plant. Mercury and selenium residues arise from the weak acid bleed treatment from the acid plant. Selenium can be recovered from these residues depending on the market demand for this metal.
Overall emissions: The emissions to air can either be stack emissions or fugitive emissions. Stack emissions are normally monitored continuously (SO2) or periodically (other emissions) and reported. The main emissions to air from zinc production are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matters including metals. Main emissions to water are metals and their compounds. The monitored metals are zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, copper and arsenic.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.', 'amount': 0.014, 'pedigree': {'reliability': 2, 'completeness': 1, 'temporal correlation': 1, 'geographical correlation': 1, 'further technological correlation': 1}, 'uncertainty type': 2, 'loc': -4.2687, 'scale': 0.20149441679609886, 'scale without pedigree': 0.2, 'name': 'fraction_PW_to_air'}, {'description': 'lifetime', 'id': '902d8a9c-c2b3-4b9e-855c-94bbe44f79db', 'unit': 'year', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.

Data was taken from the environmental report of Placer Dome Inc. for the Campbell, Musselwhite and Porcupine Mines, which produce only gold.  Campbell and Musselwhite are underground mines, whereas Porcupine has underground and open pit mines. For the inventory, most by product and exchange amounts were calculated by adding the corresponding inputs or outputs of each mine, and then scaling them to the reference flow of 1 kg of gold. Since the mines have been sold in 2006 to Kinross Gold Corporation and Goldcorp Inc., no actual data is available. Both enterprises do not publish their environmental data. Therefore, data from 2002 is used to model the gold production in Canada.

Beneficiation, concentration and refinement of gold.
total requirements and emissions of the Campbell, Musselwhite and Porcupine Mines in 2002 as well as the total for Canada.
Geography:  Material requirements for gold concentration are estimated with Australian data, air emission are estimated with Swedish data.
Technology:  OPEN PIT MINING:
The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.
UNDERGROUND MINING:
Some ore bodies are more economically mined underground. In this case, a tunnel called an adit or a shaft is dug into the earth. Sort tunnels leading from the adit or shaft, called stopes, are dug to access the ore. The surface containing the ore, called a face, is drilled and loaded with explosives. Following blasting, the broken ore is loaded onto electric trucks and taken to the surface. Once mining is completed in a particular stope, it is backfilled with a cement compound. 
ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:
The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.
BENEFICIATION:
In the Porcupine Mines, gold is recovered using a combination of gravity concentration, milling and cyanidation techniques. The milling process consists of primary crushing, secondary crushing, rod/ball mill grinding, gravity concentration, cyanide leaching, carbon-in-pulp gold recovery, stripping, electrowinning and refining. 
In the Campbell Mine, the ore from the mine, after crushing and grinding, is processed by gravity separation, flotation, pressure oxidation, cyanidation and carbon-in-pulp process followed by electro-winning and gold refining to doré on site.
The Musselwhite Mine uses gravity separation, carbon in pulp, electro¬winning and gold refining to doré on site.
REFINING:
Wohlwill electrolysis. It is assumed that the gold doré-bars from both mines undergo the treatment of Wohlwill electrolysis. This process uses an electrolyte containing 2.5 mol/l of HCl and 2 mol/l of HAuCl4 acid. Electrolysis is carried out with agitation at 65 – 75 °C. The raw gold is intro-duced as cast anode plates. The cathodes, on which the pure gold is deposited, were for many years made of fine gold of 0.25 mm thickness. These have now largely been replaced by sheet titanium or tantalum cathodes, from which the thick layer of fine gold can be peeled off. In a typical electrolysis cell, gold anodes weighing 12 kg and having dimensions 280×230×12 mm (0.138 m2 surface) are used. Opposite to them are conductively connected cathode plates, arranged by two or three on a support rail. One cell normally contains five or six cathode units and four or five anodes. The maximum cell voltage [V] is 1.5 V and the maximum anodic current density [A] 1500 A/m2. The South African Rand refinery gives a specific gold production rate of 0.2 kg per hour Wohlwill electrolysis. Assuming a current efficiency of 95% the energy consumption is [V] x [A] / 0.2 [kg/h] = 1.63 kWh per kg gold refined. No emissions are assumed because of the purity and the high value of the material processed. The resulting sludge contains the PGM present in the electric scrap and is sold for further processing.
WATER EMISSIONS:
Effluents are discharged into the ocean.

copper,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"copper mine operation and beneficiation, sulfide ore","copper concentrate, sulfide ore",CA,kilogram,"""For the mining and beneficiation of copper sulfide ores in Canada.
Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined & beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium & tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals. 
Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the life cycle inventory process model described by Classen et al. (2009) and used to generate datasets for ecoinvent v2.1. Typical average ore grades are estimated for each region based on data from Northey et al. (2014), while values for several other key input parameters have been updated since the release of the v2.1 dataset. These include (non-exclusively) the production volumes, beneficiation efficiency (i.e. yield), concentrate grades, anode slime composition (a product of the downstream copper electrorefining processing but that has a direct influence on the properties of exchanges in this dataset), and water outputs. Further information on these changes is provided in the Sampling Procedure comment, as well as the accompanying documentation (see Turner & Hischier, 2020).

Technology:  Based on typical current technology. Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.
Time period:  Production volumes are representative of the situation in 2015 but are considered valid until the end of 2019. Data sources for the inventory model have not been updated since v2.1 (see Classen et al. 2009), but important model parameters that determine input data to the model have been updated to be consistent with the current situation.

gold,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,gold-silver mine operation with refinery,silver,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset describes the production of gold and silver in Quebec (Canada) in 2012. This includes the operations at the mining site located in Quebec, i.e. mining, benefication and a first refining, which leads to the production of doré bars, containing gold, silver and impurities. 
Specific data were collected from 3 mines that produced doré bars in Quebec. These mines represent about 98% of Quebec gold production and about 95% of Quebec silver production from combined gold-silver mines. Share is estimated as the production statistics for 2012-2013 are not published yet and considers gold-silver mines only (not gold and silver coming from other mines). One mine is an open-pit mine and the two others are underground. A weighted average of 839 tonnes of ore is extracted per kg of gold produce. The recovery rate of gold is known for two of the mines (89% and 91%) and the recovery rate of silver known for only one mine (76%). 
Note that the mine infrastructure are extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset, where the modelled mines are open pit. This is not representative of the Quebec situation where two of the three modelled mine are underground. Thus a mine infrastrucuture, gold and silver, Québec will eventually be created in order to reflect the Québec specificity. 
In order to create a dataset with gold and silver as outputs (to comply with the boundaries of the GLO dataset), a very simplified modeling of the refining of the doré bars to produce gold and silver has been added to this dataset although it is done in Ontario (Canada) : electricity use is extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, PE and PG datasets and infrastructure extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset. 
It is assume that the refining efficency is 100% (i.e. no loss of gold).
Geography:  Inputs and outputs for mining, benefication and a first refining relate to Quebec production. Inputs for doré bar refining, which is done in Ontario, are extrapolated from dataset gold-silver mine operation with refinery (PG, CL, SE).
Technology:  One of the modelled mine is an open-pit mine and the two others are underground.

cadmium,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,primary zinc production from concentrate,cadmium sludge from zinc electrolysis,CA-QC,kilogram,"This dataset represents the production of high grade (SHG-Special High Grade) primary zinc by hydrometallurgical processes. Specific data were collected from the only producer in the Québec region, for the years 2011-2012.
Primary zinc is produced in the form of ingots and shot, respectively used as coating in steel work/die cast and for electroplating. About 25% of the produced zinc is in the form of an aluminium alloy.
The zinc concentrate, coming from all around the world (e.g. Canada (Québec and Ontario), Australia), is transported to the site by train or by ship and truck and mixed on site. The site is able to treate zinc concentrate contaminated with mercury and selenium but cannot recover silver and lead. Contrary to the GLO dataset, this dataset does not include waste contaning indium (""indium rich leaching residues, from zinc production"" by-product flow).
Geography:  This activity represents the production of primary zinc in the Québec region.
Technology:  Hydrometallurgical process
Sulphide concentrates are roasted first in fluidized bed roasters to produce zinc oxide (calcine) and sulphur dioxide. Roasting is an exothermic process and no additional fuel is used to sustain the reaction, the heat generated is recovered to produce steam. Calcine is then sent to the leaching step. Roaster gases are treated in hot electrostatics precipitators to remove dust. The remaining dust and volatile metals such as mercury and selenium are removed in the wet section of the acid plant through a cooling tour, a mist precipitator and a mercury tower (Boliden mercury removal processs). The sulphur dioxide is then converted to sulphuric acid in a conventional recovery system (converted and absorbing tower).
Leaching of the calcine is carried out in a number of successive stages using a gradually increasing strength of hot sulphuric acid. The initial stages dissolve the major part of the zinc oxide and the other stages dissolve the zinc ferrite (ZnO.Fe2O3) and convert iron into Jarosite (sodium Jarosite). Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) entering the electrolysis stage produce electrolyte (H2SO4) that is returned to leaching plant. Other metals are also dissolved during the process and are removed after leaching. Iron is the major impurity, which is precipitated in the form of Jarosite.
Overall waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several by-products, residues and wastes. Relatively large quantities of iron based solids, depending on the iron content, are generated by the leaching process (6.14E-1 kg Jarosite/kg zinc). Cement is added to the Jarosite to produce Jarofix (an inert waste). Solid residues also arise as the result of the liquid effluents treatment. The main waste stream is gypsum (CaSO4) and metal hydroxides that are produced at the wastewater neutralization plant. Mercury and selenium residues arise from the weak acid bleed treatment from the acid plant. Selenium can be recovered from these residues depending on the market demand for this metal.
Overall emissions: The emissions to air can either be stack emissions or fugitive emissions. Stack emissions are normally monitored continuously (SO2) or periodically (other emissions) and reported. The main emissions to air from zinc production are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matters including metals. Main emissions to water are metals and their compounds. The monitored metals are zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, copper and arsenic.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,"[{'description': 'fraction, process water, to air', 'id': 'daadf2d4-7bbb-4f69-8ab5-58df4c1685eb', 'unit': 'dimensionless', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.', 'amount': 0.014, 'pedigree': {'reliability': 2, 'completeness': 1, 'temporal correlation': 1, 'geographical correlation': 1, 'further technological correlation': 1}, 'uncertainty type': 2, 'loc': -4.2687, 'scale': 0.20149441679609886, 'scale without pedigree': 0.2, 'name': 'fraction_PW_to_air'}, {'description': 'lifetime', 'id': '902d8a9c-c2b3-4b9e-855c-94bbe44f79db', 'unit': 'year', 'comment': 'Estimation by data provider.

nickel,ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff,"treatment of sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation, tailings impoundment","sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation",CA,kilogram,"This dataset represents the activity of waste disposal of sulfidic tailings, from nickel mine operation in a tailings impoundment in Canada. 
Background: Tailings, a waste material produced during mineral concentration (beneficiation), often contain significant quantities of mobile toxic metals and are typically produced in large quantities. To manage these wastes, tailings are commonly stored behind dammed impoundments, known as tailings ponds. These ponds pose a significant long-term pollution risk as metals may leach out into the surrounding environment, potentially over very long timeframes.
Modelling approach: This dataset was produced using a model developed specifically for assessing the long-term emissions of tailings disposal (see Doka, 2017). The tailings disposal model is based on the modelling framework applied in existing landfill process models used in ecoinvent and is based on a top-down approach. Literature data on measurements of deposited tailings compositions (solids) and measured current concentrations in leachate (liquid) form the basis of the model and are used to characterise pollutant mobility and calculate the currently occurring rate of emissions of the landfill. Heeding chief parameters, such as hydrology, pH development and elemental chemistry, these emissions are then projected into the future. Tailings composition is based on the typical composition of tailings at nickel mine sites worldwide; i.e. composition is not region-specific. Land use was calculated following the approach described by Doka (2008). Based on an assumed generic final height of a tailings impoundment of 60 m and an assumed tailings density of 2200 kg/m3, a land area of 7.58E-06 m2 is required per kilogram of sulfidic tailings. The land is assumed to be converted from unknown origin to a disposal site. After an operational phase of 30 years, spontaneous restoration of a consolidated state is assumed to be reached after one hundred years. The total occupation time is therefore 130 years and the land occupation per kilogram tailings is 9.85E-04 m2.

The assumptions used for this dataset are the same as for the GLO: as roughly 70% of primary cadmium is produced as by-product by companies that produce refined zinc (in the activity ""primary zinc production from concentrate""), this dataset represents the remaining 30% of production of refined cadmium.
No secondary sources of cadmium from post consumer scrap are considered. Only the most important source is taken into account: the cadmium sludges from hydrometallurgical zinc operations (modelled in the activity ""primary zinc production from concentrate"").
For the use in applications where cadmium is a major constituent - e.g. in NiCd battery systems - the dataset should be complemented with additional specific emission factors and the secondary production process.
Geography:  Child dataset; the exchanges are identical to the GLO dataset. Created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly.
Technology:  Cadmium sludge formed in hydrometallurgical zinc operations by purification of zinc solution, via subsequent purification and oxidation of the sponge. Cadmium cathodes are formed by electrowinning. Other sources from pyrometallurgical zinc wastes and post consumer scrap (batteries) are disregarded.
OXIDATION & PURIFICATION
Cadmium is extracted by oxidizing the enriched starting materials solutions, remnants of hydrometallurgical zinc refining. In order to oxidize the cadmium, air is blown in . Cadmium is precipitated from the solution as a metal sponge by reduction with zinc dust. The precipitated sponge contains 90 % cadmium and only 2.5 % zinc. No heat is used for drying.
ELECTROWINNING
The cadmium sponge is precipitated directly in the tank with the electrolytic acid. The anode consists of lead, which does not dissolve, whereas the cathode is aluminum sheet. The current yield is ca. 93 %; the energy consumption is 1250 kWh per tonne of cadmium cathode sheet deposited. Typical impurity levels in electrolytic cadmium sheet are 5 - 10 ppm Cu, 15 - 20 ppm Pb, 5 - 10 ppm Tl, and 5 ppm Zn. The zinc dust used for cementation of the cadmium sponge is recovered later in the sludge of the electrolysis and will be returned into the zinc cycle.",,ordinary transforming activity,1.0,[],"{'data entry': {'name': 'David FitzGerald', 'email': 'fitzgerald@ecoinvent.org'}, 'data generator': {'name': 'Pascal Lesage', 'email': 'pascal.lesage@polymtl.ca'}}",
