The sulfidic tailings, off-site dataset is used as a proxy, composition of leachage to water may not fully correspond. For the modelled mine, sulfidic tailings remain on site. The landuse in the tailing dataset is much smaller than the one of the modelled mine. Landuse is hence directly added in this mine operation dataset."
