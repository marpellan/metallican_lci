  abstract = {Waste from primary mining operations, especially mine tailings, receive much attention as potential secondary resources that can transform liabilities into resources. The primary intention is to minimize mine tailings disposal problems through volume reduction while recovering secondary resources for industrial materials. However, the environmental benefits and tradeoffs behind these objectives remain unclear. This study conducts a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) study to investigate multiple reprocessing pathways of copper tailings to co-produce secondary metals and building materials. Four design options representing different value-recovery routes are constructed to assess the environmental burdens of reprocessing chains and the associated benefits from displaced virgin products. This study assesses emerging technologies in a prospective LCA, with projections of bottom-up foreground process modeling and background data like energy supply scenarios. Our analysis reveals that the assessed technologies can only be beneficial when all co-products are utilized. Results indicate that reprocessing may save from 25 up to 930~kg CO2-eq per tonne of treated copper tailings. Potential environmental benefits depend on the reprocessing routes, technology upscaling parameters, and quality of secondary products. We propose recommendations to enhance the environmental performances of mine tailings reprocessing strategies, such as switching to low-impact chemical alternatives and optimizing energy use. Our findings can support the sustainable development of the metal industry in terms of waste management and secondary resource use.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, an issue of copper production is the generation of mine waste with varying characteristics. This waste can pollute natural environments, and in particular, the heavy metal emissions of the tailings may pose long-term consequences. Currently, life cycle assessments of mine tailings are hampered by both limited data availability in the metal production value chain and lack of appropriate methodologies. We collect data from 431 active copper mine sites using a combination of information available from the market research and technical handbooks to develop site-specific life cycle inventories for disposal of tailings. The approach considers the influences of copper ore composition and local hydrology for dynamically estimating leached metals of tailings at each site. The analysis reveals that together, copper tailings from the large (i.e., porphyry) and medium-size copper deposits (i.e., volcanogenic massive sulfide and sediment-hosted) contribute to more than three quarters of the total global freshwater ecotoxicity impacts of copper tailings. This strongly correlates with hydrological conditions, leading to high infiltration rates. The generated inventories vary locally, even within single countries, showcasing the importance of site-specific models. Our study provides site-specific, dynamic emission models and thus improves the accuracy of tailing's inventories and toxicity-related impacts.},

It explores 28 publications considering goal and scope definition, Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), impact assessment (IA), and interpretation. Lessons learnt are discussed: i) tailings final disposal is an environmental hotspot in the production of several metals and manufactured goods; ii) associated key impacts on human toxicity and ecotoxicity are highly sensitive to metals mobility; iii) uncertainty in LCI modelling is rarely addressed, despite expected to be high; iv) compared to classical routes, tailings use in construction materials globally enables environmental benefits, whereas environmental performance of reprocessing needs further exploration. Moreover, mineral resources accounting in LCI of tailings management is classically inconsistently combined with some depletion- or dissipation-based IA. Yet resource dissipation in LCA is promising towards supporting more resource-efficient management. Finally, this article provides suggestions towards improved LCA of tailings management: i) ensuring compliance with standards; ii) balancing metal flows in LCI modelling; iii) rethinking resources ``to'' and ``in'' tailings in LCI/LCIA modelling; iv) developing further waste and technology-specific models of emissions from tailings final disposal; v) setting coherent scenarios of future tailings management to consistently account for emissions and resources.},

Filling the gaps in these datasets allows for more accurate targeting of strategies aiming to accelerate the reduction of GHG emissions. This study evaluates the potential of machine learning methods to automate the completion of GHG datasets. We use three datasets of increasing complexity with 18 different gap-filling methods and provide a guide to which methods are useful in which circumstances. If few dataset features are available, or the gap consists only of a missing time step in a record, then simple interpolation is often the most accurate method and complex models should be avoided. However, if more features are available and the gap involves non-reporting emitters, then machine learning methods can be more accurate than simple extrapolation. Furthermore, the secondary output of feature importance from complex models allows for data collection prioritization to accelerate the improvement of datasets. Graph-based methods are particularly scalable due to the ease of updating predictions given new data and incorporating multimodal data sources. This study can serve as a guide to the community upon which to base ever more integrated frameworks for automated detailed GHG emissions estimations, and implementation guidance is available at https://hackmd.io/@luke-scot/ML-for-GHGdatabase-completion and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10463104.

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a standardized, holistic, and multi-criteria approach to estimate the environmental impacts of a system over its entire lifecycle. Modeling the environmental impacts of future scenarios and evolving systems in LCA is challenging due to lack of knowledge around technological evolutions and changing backgrounds influencing the foreground system. The method proposed here tackles these issues by combining parameterized life cycle inventories (LCIs) of foreground and background systems to assess how background changes, for example in the energy sector, affect the environmental impacts of the foreground. First, parameterized LCIs for the heating and energy sector were developed to flexibly estimate the environmental impacts of heating, gas, and electricity trajectories. Assessing their environmental impacts is essential to avoid any burden shifting to other impacts. Thanks to their parameterization, these models can represent different geographical, temporal, or technological contexts. Second, the combination of these parameterized LCIs was implemented using the Python library lca\_algebraic, designed to enhance computational efficiency and calculation speed of LCAs. lca\_algebraic's features were extended to link parameters to specific LCIs and, hence, ease their import and export and facilitate teamwork. In a final step, the developed LCIs and lca\_algebraic library were used to estimate the environmental impacts of French heating scenarios from 2018 until 2050, as a test of the approach. The parameterized models developed within this work are available on a Git together with published reference datasets for comparison, so that the method can be adapted to evaluate similar energy trajectories for other countries or regions.

From the perspective of historical and current use data for seven major metalsiron, manganese, aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, and leadwe have generated several scenarios of potential metal demand from 2010 to 2050 under alternative patterns of global development. We have also compared those demands with various assessments of potential supply to midcentury. Five conclusions emerge: (1) The calculated demand for each of the seven metals doubles or triples relative to 2010 levels by midcentury; (2) The largest demand increases relate to a scenario in which increasingly equitable values and institutions prevail throughout the world; (3) The metal recycling flows in the scenarios meet only a modest fraction of future metals demand for the next few decades; (4) In the case of copper, zinc, and perhaps lead, supply may be unlikely to meet demand by about midcentury under the current use patterns of the respective metals; (5) Increased rates of demand for metals imply substantial new energy provisioning, leading to increases in overall global energy demand of 21-37\%. These results imply that extensive technological transformations and governmental initiatives could be needed over the next several decades in order that regional and global development and associated metal demand are not to be constrained by limited metal supply.},

  abstract = {This paper analysed and summarised the significant research outputs published on the environmental impact assessment of mining and mineral processing industries through life cycle assessment. The paper presents valuable insights in identifying the gaps, where should the focus be in the mining and mineral processing industries for a sustainable future. Mining and mineral processing industries have been the key focus of research in many countries due to its increasing sustainability concerns that affect global warming and climate change. Use of heavy equipment that consumes electrical energy, mechanical energy, and an enormous amount of process heat is a key contributor to the overall impacts in the industry. Due to the use of heavy equipment and associated energy consumption, these industrial sectors contribute notably to global warming, human health, ecosystems, and resources. Among the various environmental impact assessment tools which are widely used to identify sustainability indicators, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a well-justified approach among the practitioners and researchers. Though state of the art technological tools and resources are being used now a days, there is still a research gap in identifying the key mining processes which need to be the focus of attention. Renewable energy integration in the mineral processing sector and process heating from green energy sources is becoming the emergent field of research. The review results reveal, the assessment indicators in human health and ecosystems are key factors that are mostly missing in the previous studies which are crucial for people or community living nearby mining area. This review paper identifies the research gaps to the existing literature that can form the base for future research direction in the field of LCA and sustainable energy integration in mining and mineral processing industries.},

While primary data is among the most reliable and desirable data source types, it is often challenging to collect for industry-specific processes due to confidentiality concerns, in particular with respect to unique proprietary processes. In such cases, computer-based process simulation software can be used to fill gaps in inventory data based on mass and energy balances. While building process simulation models, engagement with industry is essential for verification of process models and validation of simulated data. Although process simulation-based life cycle inventory modelling is not a new research area, there has been no systematic review on this topic with respect to common methodological choices. To fill this gap, this systematic review aims to identify common practices in simulating LCI data using process simulation. Studies that used process simulation for LCI modelling were reviewed to identify the reasons for using process simulation, approaches for simulating LCI, software employed, validation processes, and processes to calculate and report uncertainty. Based on the review findings, a methodological framework was proposed to explain how process simulation-based LCI can be integrated with conventional LCA, specifically for industrial processes.},

Given that FAIR data sharing is not only the responsibility of the LCA practitioner, this study further investigates guidelines (e.g., data sharing standards and data management plans) and infrastructure (repositories, data formats, and nomenclature) to identify the tools and services available to LCA community which are essential to enable FAIR data sharing. Results The study identifies that although there is growing awareness to improve data sharing practices, implementation of FAIR guidelines for data sharing is seldom seen in practice. LCA studies that adhere to FAIR principles are primarily due to use of generic data repositories which provide tools to support data sharing. However, there is no guidance on how LCA specific data should be shared to ensure its findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. This study suggests a workflow to enable FAIRification of LCA data. In addition, the study recommends further efforts within the LCA community on skill and technology development, strategic funding, and recognition of the best practices in relation to data sharing. Conclusion In conclusion, this study highlights the necessity of data sharing incentives, guidelines, and platforms/repositories specific for the LCA community.},

  abstract = {Electrifying the global economy is accepted as a main decarbonization lever to reach the Paris Agreement targets. The IEA's 2050 Net Zero transition pathways all involve some degree of nuclear power, highlighting its potential as a low-carbon electricity source. Greenhouse gas emissions of nuclear power reported in the life cycle assessment literature vary widely, from a few grams of CO2 equivalents to more than 100 g/kWh, globally. The reasons for such a variation are often misunderstood when reported and used by policymakers. To fill this gap, one can make LCA models explicit, exploring the role of the most significant parameters, and develop simplified models for the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. We developed a parametric cradle-to-grave life cycle model with 20 potentially significant variables: ore grade, extraction technique, enrichment technique, and power plant construction requirements, among others. Average GHG emissions of global nuclear power in 2020 are found to be 6.1 g CO2 equiv/kWh, whereas pessimistic and optimistic scenarios provide extreme values of 5.4-122 g CO2 equiv/kWh. We also provide simplified models, one per environmental impact indicator, which can be used to estimate environmental impacts of electricity generated by a pressurized water reactor without running the full-scale model.},

  abstract = {Mineral resources are essential for reaching net-zero ambitions by 2050. There is a rising diversity of metals in electricity generation and storage technologies, as well as for mobility technologies. However, little is known about the future supply of minor elements historically mined in low volumes such as indium, tellurium, germanium, or tantalum. Those minor elements are found in lower concentrations in the ores of major elements and therefore rarely form economic deposits on their own. Such elements are often produced as byproducts of a host (or ``target commodity'', which underpins the bulk of a mine's profitability) in ore, e.g., in porphyry ore, tellurium is a byproduct where copper is the host. As a result, the primary supply of those minor elements depends on the supply of the major elements. Such dependency has not been accounted for in scenarios of the mineral supply. To address this gap, we developed a methodology to harmonize scattered data of mineral resource estimates and to calculate the mass ratio between the byproduct and the host in ores and concentrates, called the byproduct-to-host (BtH) ratio. We collected crude ore tonnage and element grades, among other key data, from the state-of-the-art literature and publicly available mining company reports. Our data set covers 3422 deposits across 141 countries providing 22 275 BtH ratios. The future supply of minor elements can be derived by multiplying the primary production of host elements by the developed BtH ratios, noting the limitations of data representativity. The open-access nature of this work facilitates the enrichment and update of this data set in the coming years.},

This research assesses data transparency in mainstream LCI databases using a two-step examination system based on source findability and accessibility. Six major databases (ecoinvent, GaBi, U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database, European Life Cycle Database, Inventory Database for Environmental Analysis, and Chinese Life Cycle Database) were analyzed by sampling processes and tracing their sources. The results reveal widespread transparency issues, with only 40\%--60\% of sampled processes having findable sources and {$<$}5\% being fully accessible in certain databases. Incomplete documentation and complex cross-referencing between processes and sources posed key barriers. The lack of transparency undermines LCA credibility and necessitates reconstructing databases for enhanced traceability. Although a preliminary study, these findings highlight the challenge of data transparency and provide a methodology to evaluate databases. This drives collective action to uphold transparency standards, restoring trust in LCA as a sustainability decision-making tool.},

  abstract = {In life cycle assessment (LCA), collecting unit process data from the empirical sources (i.e., meter readings, operation logs/journals) is often costly and time-consuming. We propose a new computational approach to estimate missing unit process data solely relying on limited known data based on a similarity-based link prediction method. The intuition is that similar processes in a unit process network tend to have similar material/energy inputs and waste/emission outputs. We use the ecoinvent 3.1 unit process data sets to test our method in four steps: (1) dividing the data sets into a training set and a test set; (2) randomly removing certain numbers of data in the test set indicated as missing; (3) using similarity-weighted means of various numbers of most similar processes in the training set to estimate the missing data in the test set; and (4) comparing estimated data with the original values to determine the performance of the estimation. The results show that missing data can be accurately estimated when less than 5\% data are missing in one process. The estimation performance decreases as the percentage of missing data increases. This study provides a new approach to compile unit process data and demonstrates a promising potential of using computational approaches for LCA data compilation.},

In this study, we shed light on the global production capacity of 32 mined geological resources, considering regional water availability as a constraint. We found that current resource mining greatly exceeds regional water constraints for several, notably copper (37\% of current production exceeds available water capacity) in 2010. Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible. Future demand for geological resources is expected to require a considerable increase in water consumption. Considering the constraints of water resources in geological resource production is crucial for sustainability.           ,              Editor's summary                            Mineral production is key to our global economy, with new technologies creating higher demand for many minerals.

Coal, iron, copper, and gold showed some of the highest overconsumption, coal because of its high production rates and the metals because they require more water to process.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one of the popular tools that can assess the impact of mining activities. Remote sensing (RS) based imagery analysis helps to explore the change in earth surface by providing long-term historical data which is very useful for mining induced environmental impact assessment. Therefore, we used the knowledge of RS based image analysis to analyze the direct footprint of mining that is the land use change. Besides, we also used LCA to quantify the environmental impacts focusing mainly on Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Gross Energy Requirement (GER). The case study site was a copper-gold-silver mine located in Laos, called Phu Kham mine. The RS based image analysis suggests that the land use change due to mining during 2007--2018 was approximately 3.98 km2 whereas the overall intensity of land use change in the same period was about 0.0052515 m2/kg of concentrate. We also analyzed the indirect CO2 emission from vegetation lost by mining. The GER of the mine showed average value for an open-pit copper mine though the CO2 emission was lower mainly due to the use of hydroelectricity. We also tried to quantify the productivity of the mine site. The findings from this study was also compared with existing literature. Though the impact of the mine was lower, there is room for improvement. We have tried to provide a few directions for that as well.},

Shifting to renewable electricity and electrifying heat for mining and refining operations and reagents production emerges as a promising avenue. Combined, these measures can reduce the GHG emissions intensity by 53\%--86\% for the analyzed production routes. However, these reductions may not achieve absolute decoupling of GHG emissions from the growing demand driven by the rollout of EVs. Bridging this gap may require additional strategies, including low-carbon haul trucks, electrification of processing equipment, reagents regeneration and/or substitution, alternative reducing agents, improvements in material recovery rates, or new and emerging production technologies.

The intensity of land use change was evaluated as the area of land use change per unit of metal contained in extracted ores. Among the six mines studied, the lowest intensity of 0.00177 [m2/kg] is very close to the reference value of 0.0018 [m2/kg] provided by the nickel industry, whereas the highest-impact mine has an intensity approximately ten times greater, at 0.0191 [m2/kg]. This wide variation is attributed to the different operational stage of each mine. It means careful and continuous monitoring of such changes is necessary. We also evaluated historical changes in land use intensity, and found a decreasing trend, which may be the result of technological developments in the downstream sector. Our results show that the use of a single, representative intensity value can be misleading. Instead, it is necessary to analyze mine-specific changes. Historical data are also useful for analyzing the impacts of technological improvements over time. Both forms of analysis are feasible by coupling satellite imagery with operational data.},

  abstract = {Purpose In this paper, we present new tools to ease the analysis of the effect of variability and uncertainty on life cycle assessment (LCA) results. Methods The tools consist of a standard protocol and an open-source library: lca\_algebraic. This library, written in Python and based on the framework Brightway2 (Mutel in J Open Source Softw 2(12):236, 2017) provides functions to support sensitivity analysis by bringing symbolic calculus to LCA. The use of symbolic calculus eases the definition of parametric inventories and enables a very fast evaluation of impacts by factorizing the background activities. Thanks to this processing speed, a large number of Monte Carlo simulations can be generated to evaluate the variation of the impacts and apply advanced statistic tools such as Sobol indices to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the final variance (Sobol in Math Comput Simul 55 (1--3):271--280, 2001). An additional algorithm uses the key parameters, identified from their high Sobol indices, to generate simplified arithmetic models for fast estimates of LCA results. Results and discussion The protocol and library were validated through their application to the assessment of impacts of mono crystalline photovoltaic (PV) systems. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed based on the protocol and the complementary functions provided by lca\_algebraic. The proposed tools helped building a detailed parametric reference LCA model of the PV system to identify the range of variation of multi-criterion LCA results and the key foreground-related parameters explaining these variations. Based on these key parameters, we generated simplified arithmetic models for quick and simple multi-criteria environmental assessments to be used by non-expert LCA users. The resulting models are both compact and aligned with the reference parametric LCA model of crystalline silicon PV systems. Conclusion This work brings powerful and practical tools to the LCA community to better understand, identify, and quantify the sources of variation of environmental impacts and produce simplified models to spread the use of LCA among nonexperts. The library mainly explores the uncertainties of the foreground activities. Further work could also integrate the uncertainty of background activities, described, for example, by pedigree matrices.},

  abstract = {Decision-making during the early stages of research and development (R\&D) should be informed by both economic and ecological perspectives. While early stage cost assessments are well established, life cycle assessment (LCA) is still largely descriptive but should expand to a more prospective tool for early assessing the ecological effects of future processes. Chemical processes should be first assessed as early as when only the reaction equation is known. Our previous comparison of estimation methods based on the reaction equation identified three requirements to foster early stage LCA: (1) estimate inventories rather than final impacts to ensure flexibility, (2) distinguish between processes, as single values cannot reflect the variety of chemical processes, (3) provide a measure of uncertainty. In this publication, we propose regression trees to estimate key inputs for industry-scale life-cycle inventories of chemical processes directly from the underlying reaction equation. In detail, the regression trees yield the raw materials' impact, the direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CO2eq, and the demands for electricity, steam, natural gas, cooling water, and process water. The regression trees outperform the current best available proxy values and provide inventory information that is as accurate as cost estimates. Thus, our work enables decisionmakers to consider environmental aspects with the same level of accuracy as costs projections.},

To this end, we jointly analyzed process-based and input outputbased data sets. We first evaluated their complementarity. Though the LCA data was more detailed overall, some sectors of the economy were more precisely represented in the EEIO database. We then contrasted the representation of the different economic sectors in the LCA database with the economic, environmental, and structural importance of these sectors. The weakness of the correlation results led us to conclude that process-inventory efforts have not been systematically directed at the most important sectors of the economy. The LCA data was also used to evaluate the sensitivity of EEIO data to aggregation uncertainty. This sensitivity proved highly inhomogeneous. We conclude the presence of important research inefficiencies stemming from the lack of hybrid perspective in the compilation of LCA and EEIO data.},

  abstract = {Sustainable battery production with low environmental footprints requires a systematic assessment of the entire value chain, from raw material extraction and processing to battery production and recycling. In order to explore and understand the variations observed in the reported footprints of raw battery materials, it is vital to re-assess the footprints of these material value chains. Identifying the causes of these variations by combining engineering and environmental system analysis expands our knowledge of the footprints of these battery materials. This article disaggregates the value chains of six raw battery materials (aluminum, copper, graphite, lithium carbonate, manganese, and nickel) and identifies the sources of variabilities (levers) for each process along each value chain. We developed a parametric attributional process-based life cycle model to explore the effect of these levers on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the value chains, expressed in kg of CO2e. The parametric life cycle inventory model is used to conduct distinct life cycle assessments (LCA) for each material value chain by varying the identified levers within defined engineering ranges. 570 distinct LCAs are conducted for the aluminum value chain, 450 for copper, 170 for graphite, 39 for lithium carbonate via spodumene, 20 for lithium carbonate via brine, 260 for manganese, and 440 for nickel. Three-dimensional representations of these results for each value chain in kg of CO2e are presented as contour plots with gradient lines illustrating the intensity of lever combinations on the GHG emissions. The results of this study convey multidimensional insights into how changes in the lever settings of value chains yield variations in the overall GHG emissions of the raw materials. Parameterization of these value chains forms a flexible and high-resolution backbone, leading towards a more reliable life cycle assessment of lithium-ion batteries (LIB).},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The growing demand for minerals has pushed mining activities into new areas increasingly affecting biodiversity-rich natural biomes. Mapping the land use of the global mining sector is, therefore, a prerequisite for quantifying, understanding and mitigating adverse impacts caused by mineral extraction. This paper updates our previous work mapping mining sites worldwide. Using visual interpretation of Sentinel-2 images for 2019, we inspected more than 34,000 mining locations across the globe. The result is a global-scale dataset containing 44,929 polygon features covering 101,583\,               km               2               of large-scale as well as artisanal and small-scale mining. The increase in coverage is substantial compared to the first version of the dataset, which included 21,060 polygons extending over 57,277\,               km               2               . The polygons cover open cuts, tailings dams, waste rock dumps, water ponds, processing plants, and other ground features related to the mining activities.

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become a crucial technique for evaluating environmental impacts across various stages of emerging clean production technologies and sustainable processes. This assessment plays a key role in guiding decision-making and policy development. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in such LCA investigations in the peer-reviewed literature. However, only a small fraction of these studies have transparently reported the foreground life cycle inventory (LCI) data of the technology under investigation. The available data are often poorly organized and lack a standard structure and metadata making them ambiguous and nonreusable. This leads to a situation where LCA outcomes must be accepted at face value due to irreplicable results. Currently, there are no standardized methods for publishing and sharing foreground LCIs with the relevant contextual information. To address this gap, this work develops a novel, minimalistic, user-centric, machineaccessible, and extensible schema based on the Brightway LCA framework to share the foreground LCI of standard (non-temporal) LCA investigations. In this schema, an inventory is made up of five components: dataset, dataset properties, metadata, dependencies, and network. A Python-based open-source tool has also been developed to convert LCIs according to the specifications of this schema. The proposed schema and the tool are demonstrated for the exemplary use case of an aviation fuel supply chain. This schema can improve the reusability and reliability of LCI datasets, a first step towards transparent, replicable, and robust LCA studies.},

However, there have been increasing concerns regarding the reliability of supply of some of these metals. A main contributor to these concerns is the fact that many of these metals are recovered only as by-products from a limited number of geopolitically concentrated ore deposits, rendering their supplies unable to respond to rapid changes in demand. Companionality is the degree to which a metal is obtained largely or entirely as a by-product of one or more host metals from geologic ores. The dependence of companion metal availability on the production of the host metals introduces a new facet of supply risk to modern technology. We evaluated companionality for 62 different metals and metalloids, and show that 61\% (38 of 62) have companionality greater than 50\%. Eighteen of the 38---including such technologically essential elements as germanium, terbium, and dysprosium---are further characterized as having geopolitically concentrated production and extremely low rates of end-of-life recycling. It is this subset of companion metals---vital in current technologies such as electronics, solar energy, medical imaging, energy-efficient lighting, and other state-of-the-art products---that may be at the greatest risk of supply constraints in the coming decades.},

In this analysis, we provide a comprehensive examination of RMRs for 25 commodities for 2018. The results indicate significant variability across commodities. Precious metals like gold have RMRs in the range of 105-106, while iron ore and aluminum are on the order of 101. The results also indicate significant variability across operations for a single commodity. The interquartile range of RMRs for individual cobalt operations, for example, varies from 465 to 2157, with a global RMR of 859. RMR variability is mainly driven by ore grades and revenue contribution. The total attributable ore mined and waste rock removed in the production of these 25 commodities sums to 37.6 billion metric tons, 83\% of which is attributable to iron ore, copper, and gold. RMRs provide an additional dimension for evaluating the impact of materials and material choice tradeoffs. The results can enhance life cycle inventories and be extended to evaluate areas of surface disturbances, mine tailings, energy requirements, and associated greenhouse gas emissions.},

These risks propagate both along the life cycle and across national boundaries in a multilayer network. However, most previous studies are either only based on static network measures or focused on individual layers, ignoring dynamic cascading risks and interconnected and interdependent relationships along life cycle stages and across economies. Here, we integrated trade-linked material flow and complex network analyses to investigate intricate interconnections, interdependencies, and systematic risks of the global lithium supply chain. Both static and dynamic measures of the global lithium supply chain network exhibit a ``robust-yet-fragile'' property: robust for random shocks yet fragile for targeted shocks and robust for small or local disruptions yet fragile for large or cascading failures. Portugal, Brazil, Singapore, Canada, Finland, Norway, South Africa, Israel, Hungary, and the United Arab Emirates are most likely to be affected by supply disruptions. A hypothetical USA-China trade decoupling will increase the severity and susceptibility of network-wide failures by around 5\%. Our results call for global collaborations and collective efforts to balance efficiency and security and avoid a ``zero-sum game'' in securing the lithium supply chain.},

Here, we present the first comprehensive life cycle assessment of GHG emissions produced from the mining and milling of uranium in Canada. The study includes data from 2006-2013 for two uranium mine-mill operations in northern Saskatchewan (SK) and data from 1995-2010 for a third SK mine-mill operation. The minemill operations were determined to have GHG emissions intensities of 81, 64, and 34 kg CO2e/kg U3O8 at average ore grades of 0.74\%, 1.54\%, and 4.53\% U3O8, respectively. The production-weighted average GHG emission intensity is 42 kg CO2e/kg U3O8 at an average ore grade of 3.81\% U3O8. The production-weighted average GHG emission intensity drops to 24 kg CO2e/kg U3O8 when the local hydroelectric GHG emission factor (7.2 g CO2e/kWh) is substituted for the SK grid-average electricity GHG emission factor (768 g CO2e/kWh). This results in Canadian uranium mining-milling contributing only 1.1 g CO2e/kWh to total life cycle GHG emissions from the nuclear fuel cycle (0.7 g CO2e/kWh using the local hydroelectric emission factor).},

  abstract = {Recycling is a commonly acknowledged strategy to reduce the environmental impacts linked to primary resource exploitation. Large regional variations can be observed in recycling processes' parameters, like efficiency, energy mix and treatment of rejects. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is widely used to evaluate the environmental impacts of recycling processes, but existing studies are neither harmonized nor sufficient to provide a comprehensive geographical and technological coverage of recycling processes. The purpose of this research is to develop an efficient and iterative approach for the parametrized generation of semi-automated regionalized life-cycle inventories that take into account technological and geographical variabilities in the recycling sector. The regionalization framework is then applied to create a parametrized paper recycling regionalization tool. This tool is used in the results section to compare the national climate change impacts of recycling three paper grades. Results show a significant global warming impact variability between countries for recycled graphic paper (0.36 to 2.25 kg CO2-Eq/kg wastepaper recycled), newsprint (0.27 to 1.84 kg CO2-Eq/kg wastepaper recycled) and corrugated cardboard (0.28 to 1.68 kg CO2-Eq/kg wastepaper recycled) productions. A regionalized LCA of the international recycling of the mixed wastepaper exported from Quebec's (Canada) sorting centers is also performed with the tool and compared to the non-regionalized mixed wastepaper recycling process available in the ecoinvent database. Only nine midpoint ReCiPe impact categories remain environmentally advantageous compared to virgin paper production when applying the regionalization methodology, compared to sixteen when using the ecoinvent process, illustrating how regionalization can substantially influence LCA results.},

The use of a multicriteria assessment tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of the production of these elements is still poorly developed. Therefore, science-based decisions to achieve carbon neutrality are limited as the whole life cycle is generally not considered. This systematic review was conducted to analyse three main aspects: (i) the context of LCA application in the mining industry, (ii) the methodology followed by LCA practitioners in literature, and (iii) the environmental impacts of different metals and minerals in multiple contexts. Seventy-eight (78) papers studying the life cycle of different metals and minerals were analyzed. The results of the methodology adopted in literature show some tendencies in terms of functional unit, system boundary, data source and software used. Among the studied elements, gold showed the highest impact in the global warming potential (GWP), terrestrial acidification (TP), water depletion (WD) and land use (LU). In the other hand, the comparison of those elements' global carbon footprint in 2021 showed that coal has scored the highest impact at 1.49x109 t CO2 eq. This study highlights also the need to conduct more LCA studies on strategic metals (Li, Co, Mn, REE) for the clean energy transition to reach the net zero carbon target. Moreover, a comparative analysis between the reported data in the Ecoinvent database and the average values extracted from literature showed aligned results for GWP while it reveals a gap for the other indicators.},

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) plays a crucial role in green manufacturing to uncover the critical aspects for alleviating the environmental burdens due to manufacturing processes. However, the scarcity of life cycle inventory (LCI) data for the manufacturing processes is a considerable challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to extrapolate LCI data of manufacturing processes. Taking advantage of LCI data in the Ecoinvent datasets, decision tree-based supervised machine learning models, namely decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and adaptive boosting, have been developed to extrapolate the data of GHG emissions, i.e., carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and water vapor. Initially, a correlation analysis was conducted to derive the most influential factors on GHG quantities resulting from manufacturing activities. First, the collected data have been preprocessed and split into train and test sets (70\% and 30\%, respectively). Second, a five-fold crossvalidation method was applied to tune the hyperparameters of the models. Then, the models were re-trained using the best hyperparameters and evaluated using the test set. The results reveal that the Gradient Boosting model has a superior predictive performance for extrapolating the GHG emission data, with average coefficients of determination (R2) on the test set {$<$}0.95. Moreover, the model predictions involve relatively low values of the average root mean squared error and an average mean percentage of error on the test set. The correlation and feature importance analyses emphasized that the workpiece material and manufacturing technology have a considerable effect on natural resource consumption, i.e., energy, material, and water inflows into the process. Meanwhile, energy consumption, water usage, and raw aluminum depletion were the most influential factors in GHG emissions. Eventually, a case study to extrapolate the inflows and the outflows for new manufacturing activities has been conducted using the validated models. The proposed GraBoost model provides a computational supplementary approach to estimate and extrapolate the GHG emissions for different manufacturing processes when LCI data are incomplete or don't exist within LCI databases.},

  abstract = {Lithium (Li) is essential for decarbonization strategies, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, which experiences the largest growth rates among metals required for low-carbon technologies. To meet this demand, the raw materials sector must increase current capacities and develop new capacities at untapped deposits. Understanding life cycle impacts is crucial to avoid severe environmental burden shifts in the future. Although site-specific life cycle inventories exist, they do not allow for a comprehensive global assessment of the Li sector, particularly in capturing technological developments. To address this, our study presents a life cycle inventory model for brines that maintains essential site-specific parameters while providing a global perspective. We define core parameters for site-specific modeling of Li carbonate (Li2CO3) production and develop a systematic approach to addressing data gaps. Our model employs a class-based structure for 30 mapped processes from the literature and quantifies environmental and technical flows. Overall, we cover 25 sites, representing 300 kilotonnes (90\%) of current Li2CO3 production from brines and an additional 315 kilotonnes of potential future production. One key finding is that sites using direct Li extraction have 7-fold higher climate change impacts than sites using conventional technologies on average, while water scarcity impacts are doubled on average. The difference is a result of the larger brine mass required to be treated due to lower Li grades. Furthermore, our model allows the implications for Li-ion battery production to be analyzed.},

  abstract = {While many different lithium carbonate production routes have been developed, existing life cycle assessments (LCA) of lithium carbonate production from brines are mainly based on a single brine operation site. Hence, current life cycle inventories do not capture the variability of brine sites and misestimate life cycle impacts. This study presents a systematic approach for LCA of existing and future lithium carbonate production from brines, which can furthermore be applied to geothermal brines or seawater. It has been used to model life cycle inventories of three existing and two upcoming brine operations in Argentina, Chile, and China, and is combined with regionalized life cycle impact assessment. Impacts on climate change, particulate matter human health impacts, and water scarcity from lithium carbonate production differ substantially among sites. Existing life cycle inventories for lithium-ion battery production underestimate climate change impacts by up to 19\% compared to one from our study.},

  abstract = {Global resource extraction raises concerns about environmental pressures and the security of mineral supply. Strategies to address these concerns depend on robust information on natural resource endowments, and on suitable methods to monitor and model their changes over time. However, current mineral resources and reserves reporting and accounting workflows are poorly suited for addressing mineral depletion or answering questions about the longterm sustainable supply. Our integrative review finds that the lack of a robust theoretical concept and framework for mass-balance (MB)consistent geological stock accounting hinders systematic industrygovernment data integration, resource governance, and strategy development. We evaluate the existing literature on geological stock accounting, identify shortcomings of current monitoring of mine production, and outline a conceptual framework for MB-consistent system integration based on material flow analysis (MFA). Our synthesis shows that recent developments in Earth observation, geoinformation management, and sustainability reporting act as catalysts that make MB-consistent geological stock accounting increasingly feasible. We propose first steps for its implementation and anticipate that our perspective as ``resource realists'' will facilitate the integration of geological and anthropogenic material systems, help secure future mineral supply, and support the global sustainability transition.},

A fundamental tool in this context is life-cycle assessment (LCA), a methodology designed to quantify the environmental impacts associated with products, services, or processes. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of LCA research in the mining industry to provide an overview of the development of this field. The methodology consisted of three steps: (1) searching for publications on the Web of Science, (2) screening documents, and (3) conducting data analyses using the Bibliometrix software package. Consequently, 63 papers published between 2000 and 2024 were identified, including original articles, review articles, conference proceedings, and book chapters. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and Australia are the institution and country with the most publications, and Minerals Engineering is the most prominent journal in this field. It was also found that LCA has been applied to diverse mining--metallurgical processes, extraction of various metals and minerals, consumption of natural resources, evaluation of machinery and fuels, and waste management. The application of LCA in mining is still limited owing to the lack of uniformity in methodology and the paucity of data for the mining--metallurgical sector; therefore, these obstacles must be addressed in future research.},

Here, we conduct a mining site-specific environmental impact assessment of lithium on a global scale, focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, and land use. We then track the production and international trade flows of all lithium-containing commodities to assess how lithium mining impacts are distributed across global supply chains. Results indicate that environmental impact intensities of battery-grade Li2CO3 production from various mine sites differ between 4 times for GHG emissions to 2885 times for land use. 56-68\% of environmental impacts generated in the mining countries were embodied in internationally traded lithium flows. On the production side, China, Australia, and Chile were the top 3 countries, accounting for 91-94\% of environmental impacts. Regarding final demand, China was the major consuming region, inducing 46-47\% of the environmental impacts of global lithium mining, followed by Korea (17-18\%) and the EU-27 (9\%). Our findings reveal the need for spatially explicit information to accurately assess the environmental impacts of lithium mining and highlight that mitigation requires cooperation between major producer and consumer countries.},

Some LCIA methods are based on ore grade changes, but they typically do not consider the impact of changes in primary metal extraction technology. To characterize the impact of technology changes for copper, we modeled and analyzed energy demand, expressed in fossil energy equivalents (FEE) per kilogram of primary copper, taking into account the applied mining method and processing technology. The model was able to capture variations in reported energy demands of selected mining sites (FEE: 0.07 to 0.84 MJeq/kg ore) with deviations of 1 to 30\%. Applying the model to a database containing global mine production data resulted in energy demand median values of around 50 MJ/kg Cu irrespective of the processing route, even though median values of ore demands varied between processing routes from ca. 35 (underground, conventional processing) to 200 kg ore/kg Cu (open pit, solvent-extraction, and electrowinning), as high specific ore demands are typically associated with less energy intensive extraction technologies and vice versa. Thus, only considering ore grade in LCIA methods without making any differentiation with regard to employed technology can produce misleading results.},

The present study analyzes the life cycle environmental impact of copper concentrate production, along with selection of a typical copper sulphate mine in China. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted using SimaPro with ReCiPe 2016 method. The midpoint and endpoint results were performed with uncertainty information based on Monte Carlo calculation. Normalization of midpoint results revealed that impact from the marine ecotoxicity category was the largest contributor to the total environmental impact, followed by freshwater ecotoxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity, human non-carcinogenic toxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The mining activity, backfilling activity, and electricity generation were proved to be the dominant factors. In addition, main processes and substances to the identified key categories were also classified. Specifically, the cement production in the backfilling process, blasting activity, on-site emission, and electricity generation was regarded as the critical processes. Copper to air and zinc emission to water were considered the critical substances. The sensitivity analysis revealed the most effective measure to solve the environmental problems caused by the concentrate production process, which is controlling on-site emissions and reducing pollution from cement production. Finally, the corresponding technical and management measures were proposed to facilitate the development of cleaner metal industry.},

The analysis considers the fuel type, main production stages and the energy footprint of up to 25 chemicals. This study provides new insights into 39 infrequently studied metals. Results show that by using renewable electricity in production, 41 metals can reduce their carbon footprint by up to 50 \%. However, key metals such as Fe or Li require additional decarbonization efforts beyond electricity.

Traditional mechanistic methods (e.g., process simulation) and existing machine learning (ML) methods (e.g., similarity-based selection methods) are inadequate due to their limitations in scalability and generalizability. The large language models (LLMs) are well-positioned to address these challenges, given the massive and diverse knowledge learned through the pretraining step. Incorporating LLMs into LCI modeling can lead to the automation of inventory data curation from diverse data sources and to the implementation of a multimodal analytical capacity. In this article, we delineated the mechanisms and advantages of LLMs to addressing these two grand challenges. We also discussed the future research to enhance the use of LLMs for LCI modeling, which includes the key areas such as improving retrieval augmented generation (RAG), integration with knowledge graphs, developing prompt engineering strategies, and fine-tuning pretrained LLMs for LCI-specific tasks. The findings from our study serve as a foundation for future research on scalable and automated LCI modeling methods that can provide more appropriate data for LCA calculations.},

Our findings showed that global demand for these major metals is likely to increase continuously over the 21st century, increasing approximately 2--6-fold depending on the metal. Although the extraction and processing required to meet this increase in demand must be environmentally sustainable, the existing extraction and processing scenarios have few explicit linkages to the Earth's carrying capacity. We further found that strategy choices are heavily biased towards endof-life phase analyses, specifically that of end-of-life recycling. Consequently, a full range of opportunities across entire life cycles is being overlooked, including advances in product design, manufacturing and in-use phases. Importantly, despite the emergence of numerous scenarios, few provide science-based targets for major metal flows, stock, circularity, and efficiency. These knowledge gaps need to be addressed urgently in order to ensure that future research directly supports science-based decision and policy making.},

Here, we provide the first systematic review of studies (88 studies in all) exploring the projected long-term status of various critical materials, covering 48 elements with 546 data points for global demand through 2030 and 2050. Interestingly, results indicate that, to date, no long-term demand outlook is available for some high criticality metals. We also find that the social and environmental implications induced by demand growth are largely overlooked in these studies, resulting in less attention being given to the spatial divergence between consuming and producing countries in the global supply chain. Moreover, circular economy strategies that include component reuse and remanufacturing have been barely incorporated into the modelling frameworks presented in these studies, while end-of-life recycling is heavily focused on. In addition, elemental linkages (e.g., indium-zinc-steel) are underemphasized, leading to a lack of understanding of future availability and sustainable cycles. All of these findings affirm the need for further scientific research that explores the long-term status of critical metals, which strongly connects to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations and implementation of the Paris Agreement.},

At a local level, these include environmental and socioeconomic risk assessments, disaster mitigation, and adjudication on mine-related conflicts. At a regional level, spatial analyses can support cumulative and strategic impact assessments. At a global level, spatial analyses can reveal industry-wide land use trends, and provide key land use data for comparative analyses of mining impacts between commodities, locations, and mine configurations.

Further efforts on lowering per capita in-use metal stocks and GHG emission intensity of metal production and promoting recycling are the key to achieve the climate goal.           ,              Climate change is an urgent global challenge, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from metal production contribute to a substantial part of total emissions. Metals play an essential role in human life, and their demand will increase with global population and economic growth. Therefore, projecting future GHG emissions associated with metal production and exploring effective measures to alleviate GHG emissions are essential for achieving climate goals. This study projects the future GHG emissions associated with the primary and secondary production of six metals (aluminum, copper, iron, lead, nickel, and zinc) by considering the detailed metal cycles according to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Additionally, influential factors for GHG emissions in metal cycles are explored using decomposition and sensitivity analyses to reduce future GHG emissions. We show that future GHG emissions from metal production cannot be in line with the climate goal required to maintain the temperature change below 2 {$^\circ$}C under any SSP, even though the trends for GHG emissions from metal production are significantly different among the SSPs. Therefore, substantial efforts to reduce GHG emissions are required in addition to the transition to the sustainable socio-economic pathway. From a short-term perspective, lowering the per capita in-use metal stock level and GHG emission intensity of metal production is crucial, especially in middle income groups. From a long-term perspective, improving the recycling rate is a possible step after sufficient in-use metal stocks are accumulated for recycling. To achieve the climate goals for both short- and long-term GHG reductions in metal cycles, a combination of actions on these influential factors without delay is essential.},

Major strategies to address this issue include proxy selection (i.e., selecting a surrogate dataset to represent the missing data) and data creation (e.g., through empirical equations or mechanistic models). Within these two strategies, we identified three approaches that are widely used for LCI modeling: Data-driven, mechanistic, and future (e.g., 2050) inventory modeling. We critically reviewed the 12 common methods of these three approaches by focusing on their features, scope of application, underlying assumptions, and limitations. These methods were characterized based on the following criteria: ``domain knowledge requirement'' (both as a method developer and a user), ``post-treatment requirement,'' ``challenge in assessing data quality uncertainty,'' ``challenge in generalizability,'' and ``challenge in automation.'' These criteria can be used by LCA practitioners to select the suitable method(s) to bridge the data gap in LCI modeling, based on the goal and scope of the intended study. We also identified several aspects for future improvement for these reviewed methods.},

  abstract = {Coal is the primary energy source in China, and its life cycle inventory (LCI) is widely used as background data for life cycle assessment studies. Previous research indicates that the inventory of coal production varies regionally. However, the development of complete regionalized LCIs for coal production is quite limited. Here, we establish the first provincial-level LCIs of local coal production and market for coal in China, based on a database of 6,122 coal mines and developed models. In the inventory results of local coal production, the coefficients of variation (CVs) of nine indicators exceed 0.5, especially SO2 and particulate matter emission factors (CVs {$>$} 1). Compared with that, the interprovincial coal trade homogenizes the provincial production inventory of market for coal relatively, despite four indicators with CVs exceeding 0.5. Therefore, the regionalized inventory with remarkable spatial differentiation can provide more accurate fundamental data for future research such as electricity production. Furthermore, CH4 emissions from coal production account for 24\% of China's total methane emissions, highlighting its significance in mitigating global warming. Moreover, through the increasing coal trade, the significant and implicit plunder of water resources from the three coal net-exporting provinces, located in water-scarce areas, should be noted.},

  abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a systematic approach to quantify the environmental impacts of a product system from its entire life cycle. Despite its wide use in assessing mature technologies, the inventory data gap has been a fundamental challenge that limits the application of LCA to emerging new processes. Machine learning (ML) methods are among the possible solutions that can mitigate these data gaps in an automated and scalable way. Nonetheless, the performance of existing ML methods is unstable which limits the trustworthiness and generalizability of the models. In this study, we conducted a data-centric investigation to delineate the causes of the unstable performance using a similarity-based ML framework based on Ecoinvent 3.1 unit process (UPR) database. We found that the pattern of imbalance in the data for method development, manifest by the substantial differences in (1) flow and process availability and (2) the order of magnitude of their values, is a major cause of the unstable performance. We also identified the causes due to the challenges with ML method development workflow, particularly, the steps of data preprocessing, and ML model training (e.g., randomness in train--test data splits). In addition, we also tested the proposed ML method on the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database, where we observed that the generalizability of the method was highly influenced by the database size of the application. To address these issues, we proposed that further research should focus on reducing the barriers in database integration such that both the size and balance of the data for ML method development can be improved.},
